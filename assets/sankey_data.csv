Abstract: We define the concept of Dynamic Passive Haptic Feedback (DPHF) for virtual reality by introducing the weight-shifting physical DPHF proxy object Shifty. This concept combines actuators known from active haptics and physical proxies known from passive haptics to construct proxies that automatically adapt their passive haptic feedback. We describe the concept behind our ungrounded weight-shifting DPHF proxy Shifty and the implementation of our prototype. We then investigate how Shifty can, by automatically changing its internal weight distribution, enhance the user's perception of virtual objects interacted with in two experiments. In a first experiment, we show that Shifty can enhance the perception of virtual objects changing in shape, especially in length and thickness. Here, Shifty was shown to increase the user's fun and perceived realism significantly, compared to an equivalent passive haptic proxy. In a second experiment, Shifty is used to pick up virtual objects of different virtual weights. The results show that Shifty enhances the perception of weight and thus the perceived realism by adapting its kinesthetic feedback to the picked-up virtual object. In the same experiment, we additionally show that specific combinations of haptic, visual and auditory feedback during the pick-up interaction help to compensate for visual-haptic mismatch perceived during the shifting process.

Abstract: The latest wearable technologies demand more intuitive and sophisticated interfaces for communication, sensing, and feedback closer to the body. Evidently, such interfaces require flexibility and conformity without losing their functionality even on rigid surfaces. Although there have been various research efforts in creating tactile feedback to improve various haptic interfaces and master slave manipulators, we are yet to see a comprehensive device that can both supply vibratory actuation and tactile sensing. This paper describes a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA)-based skin prototype that allows bidirectional tactile information transfer to facilitate simpler and responsive wearable interface. We describe the design and fabrication of a 1.4 mm-thick vibratory SPA skin that is integrated with piezoelectric sensors. We examine in detail the mechanical performance compared to the SPA model and the sensitivity of the sensors for the application in vibrotactile feedback. Experimental findings show that this ultra-thin SPA and the unique integration process of the discrete lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based piezoelectric sensors achieve high resolution of soft contact sensing as well as accurate control on vibrotactile feedback by closing the control loop.

Abstract: The combination of particle jamming and pneumatics allows the simultaneous control of shape and mechanical properties in a tactile display. A hollow silicone membrane is molded into an array of thin cells, each filled with coffee grounds such that adjusting the vacuum level in any individual cell rapidly switches it between flexible and rigid states. The array clamps over a pressure-regulated air chamber with internal mechanisms designed to pin the nodes between cells at any given height. Various sequences of cell vacuuming, node pinning, and chamber pressurization allow the surface to balloon into a variety of shapes. Experiments were performed to expand existing physical models of jamming at the inter-particle level to define the rheological characteristics of jammed systems from a macroscopic perspective, relevant to force-displacement interactions that would be experienced by human users. Force-displacement data show that a jammed cell in compression fits a Maxwell model and a cell deflected in the center while supported only at the edges fits a Zener model, each with stiffness and damping parameters that increase at higher levels of applied vacuum. This provides framework to tune and control the mechanical properties of a jamming haptic interface.

Abstract: Augmented and virtual reality have the potential of being indistinguishable from the real world. Holographic displays, including head mounted units, support this vision by creating rich stereoscopic scenes, with objects that appear to float in thin air - often within arms reach. However, one has but to reach out and grasp nothing but air to destroy the suspension of disbelief. Snake-charmer is an attempt to provide physical form to virtual objects by revisiting the concept of Robotic Graphics or Encountered-type Haptic interfaces with current commodity hardware. By means of a robotic arm, Snake-charmer brings physicality to a virtual scene and explores what it means to truly interact with an object. We go beyond texture and position simulation and explore what it means to have a physical presence inside a virtual scene. We demonstrate how to render surface characteristics beyond texture and position, including temperature; how to physically move objects; and how objects can physically interact with the users hand. We analyze our implementation, present the performance characteristics, and provide guidance for the construction of future physical renderers.

Abstract: Ungrounded haptic devices for virtual reality (VR) applications lack the ability to convincingly render the sensations of a grasped virtual objects rigidity and weight. We present Grabity, a wearable haptic device designed to simulate kinesthetic pad opposition grip forces and weight for grasping virtual objects in VR. The device is mounted on the index finger and thumb and enables precision grasps with a wide range of motion. A unidirectional brake creates rigid grasping force feedback. Two voice coil actuators create virtual force tangential to each finger pad through asymmetric skin deformation. These forces can be perceived as gravitational and inertial forces of virtual objects. The rotational orientation of the voice coil actuators is passively aligned with the real direction of gravity through a revolute joint, causing the virtual forces to always point downward. This paper evaluates the performance of Grabity through two user studies, finding promising ability to simulate different levels of weight with convincing object rigidity. The first user study shows that Grabity can convey various magnitudes of weight and force sensations to users by manipulating the amplitude of the asymmetric vibration. The second user study shows that users can differentiate different weights in a virtual environment using Grabity.

Abstract: CLAW is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. Our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the users grasp. A servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. Using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. CLAW also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. We describe the design considerations for CLAW and evaluate its performance through two user studies. The first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. The second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and experimental validation of a haptic glove mechanism: the RML glove (Robotics and Mechatronics Lab). The designed haptic interface is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained mechatronic system that fits on a bare hand and provides haptic force feedback to each finger of the hand without constraining their movement. In order to experimentally test the new design, teleportation with this glove for mobile robot navigation is also studied. By comparing teleportation experiments with and without force feedback, the results show that this new admittance (using force as input and position as output) glove with force feedback can provide effective force feedback to the user and augment telepresence.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and experimental validation of a haptic glove mechanism: the RML glove (Robotics and Mechatronics Lab). The designed haptic interface is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained mechatronic system that fits on a bare hand and provides haptic force feedback to each finger of the hand without constraining their movement. In order to experimentally test the new design, teleportation with this glove for mobile robot navigation is also studied. By comparing teleportation experiments with and without force feedback, the results show that this new admittance (using force as input and position as output) glove with force feedback can provide effective force feedback to the user and augment telepresence.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental validation of a novel robotic haptic exoskeleton device to measure the users hand motion and assist hand motion while remaining portable and lightweight. The device consists of a five-finger mechanism actuated with miniature DC motors through antagonistically routed cables at each finger, which act as both active and passive force actuators. The SAFE Glove is a wireless and self-contained mechatronic system that mounts over the dorsum of a bare hand and provides haptic force feedback to each finger. The glove is adaptable to a wide variety of finger sizes without constraining the range of motion. This makes it possible to accurately and comfortably track the complex motion of the finger and thumb joints associated with common movements of hand functions, including grip and release patterns. The glove can be wirelessly linked to a computer for displaying and recording the hand status through 3D Graphical User Interface (GUI) in real-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAFE Glove is capable of reliably modeling hand kinematics, measuring finger motion and assisting hand grasping motion. Simulation and experimental results show the potential of the proposed system in rehabilitation therapy and virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Exoskeletons offer an intuitive method for actuating multiple DOF of the body; this makes them attractive for applications where generation and coupling of artificial forces to the limbs is needed. Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand.

Abstract: This work presents the Haptic Thimble, a novel wearable haptic device for surface exploration. The Haptic Thimble combines rendering of surface orientation with fast transient and wide frequency bandwidth tactile cues. Such features allow surface exploration with rich tactile feedback, including reactive contact - no contact transition, rendering of collisions, surface asperities and textures. Above capabilities were obtained through a novel serial kinematics wrapped around the finger, actuated by compact servo motor for orienting the last link, and by a custom voice coil for actuating the plate in contact with the fingerpad. Performance of the voice coil were measured at the bench in static and dynamic conditions, assessing the capability of reproducing generic, wide-bandwidth (0-300 Hz) tactile cues. Overall usability of the Haptic Thimble was explored within a virtual environment involving exploration of virtual surfaces. Finally, a perceptual experiment executed in a teleoperated environment with kinesthetic feedback, showed that the addition of tactile feedback, provided through the Haptic Thimble, significantly improved performance of an exploratory task.

Abstract: A virtual touch screen concept using an optical see-through head-mounted display has been suggested. With a virtual touch screen, the user's direct-touch interactions are allowed in much the same way as a conventional touch screen, but the absence of haptic feedback and physical constraint leads to poor user performance. To overcome this issue, we developed a wearable haptic device, called HapThimble. It provides various types of haptic feedback (tactile, pseudoforce, and vibrotactile) to the user's fingertip and mimics physical buttons based on force-penetration depth curves. We conducted three experiments with HapThimble. The first experiment confirmed that HapThimble could increase a users' performance when conducting clicking and dragging tasks. The second experiment revealed that users could differentiate between six types of haptic feedback, rendered based on different force-penetration depth curves obtained using HapThimble. Last, we conducted a test to investigate the similarity between the physical buttons and the mimicked haptic buttons and obtained a 90.3% success rate.

Abstract: Wearable technologies are gaining great popularity in the recent years. The demand for devices that are lightweight and compact challenges researchers to pursue innovative solutions to make existing technologies more portable and wearable. In this paper we present a novel wearable cutaneous fingertip device with 3 degrees of freedom. It is composed of two parallel platforms: the upper body is fixed on the back of the finger, housing three small servo motors, and the mobile end-effector is in contact with the volar surface of the fingertip. The two platforms are connected by three articulated legs, actuated by the motors in order to move the mobile platform toward the users fingertip and re-angle it to simulate contacts with arbitrarily oriented surfaces. Each leg is composed of two rigid links, connected to each other and then to the platforms, according to a RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical) kinematic chain. With respect to other similar cable-driven devices presented in the literature, this device solves the indeterminacy due to the underactuation of the platform. This work presents the main design steps for the development of the wearable display, along with its kinematics, quasi-static modeling, and control. In particular, we analyzed the relationship between device performance and its main geometrical parameters. A perceptual experiment shows that the cutaneous device is able to effectively render different platform configurations.

The demand for devices that are lightweight and compact challenges researchers to pursue innovative solutions to make existing technologies more portable and wearable. In this paper we present a novel wearable cutaneous fingertip device with 3 degrees of freedom. It is composed of two parallel platforms: the upper body is fixed on the back of the finger, housing three small servo motors, and the mobile end-effector is in contact with the volar surface of the fingertip. The two platforms are connected by three articulated legs, actuated by the motors in order to move the mobile platform toward the users fingertip and re-angle it to simulate contacts with arbitrarily oriented surfaces. Each leg is composed of two rigid links, connected to each other and then to the platforms, according to a RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical) kinematic chain. With respect to other similar cable-driven devices presented in the literature, this device solves the indeterminacy due to the underactuation of the platform. This work presents the main design steps for the development of the wearable display, along with its kinematics, quasi-static modeling, and control. In particular, we analyzed the relationship between device performance and its main geometrical parameters. A perceptual experiment shows that the cutaneous device is able to effectively render different platform configurations.

Abstract: In this paper, we report an integrated soft and transparent visuo-haptic interface, which is compatible with flexible devices and wearable gadgets. The visuo-haptic interface is composed of a touch-sensitive visual display based on polymer waveguides and a dielectric elastomer microactuators (DEMA) array. The touch-sensitive visual display, formed via continuative multistep photolithography, is a multilayered structure with a tactile-sensing layer stacked onto a visual-imaging layer. The dual-functional layer is thin (total thickness: <200 mu m) and transparent (transmittance: as high as 90%). The DEMA forming a unit cell of the array is designed as multiple three-dimensional structures with silver nanowires (AgNWs) compliant electrode. When an electric voltage is applied across compliant electrodes formed on the sides, individual microactuators expand directly in an upward direction. Thanks to the vertically deformable design, the DEMA produces programmable large normal forces up to about 30 times of thresholds at a localized area. An output force response of the DEMA is reversible, fast (<1 ms delay), durable (output force degradation: <8% during a million cycles), and large enough to be used in human tactile interfaces. Due to the synergetic benefits from the functional layers, the visuo-haptic interface allows demonstration of programmable tactile response with visual information while being intimately attached on human skin.

Abstract: One of the main barriers to immersivity during object manipulation in virtual reality is the lack of realistic haptic feedback. Our goal is to convey compelling interactions with virtual objects, such as grasping, squeezing, pressing, lifting, and stroking, without requiring a bulky, world-grounded kinesthetic feedback device (traditional haptics) or the use of predetermined passive objects (haptic retargeting). To achieve this, we use a pair of finger-mounted haptic feedback devices that deform the skin on the fingertips to convey cutaneous force information from object manipulation. We show that users can perceive differences in virtual object weight and that they apply increasing grasp forces when lifting virtual objects as rendered mass is increased. Moreover, we show how naive users perceive changes of a virtual objects physical properties when we use skin deformation to render objects with varying mass, friction, and stiffness. These studies demonstrate that fingertip skin deformation devices can provide a compelling haptic experience appropriate for virtual reality scenarios involving object manipulation.

Abstract: We present a novel three Revolute-Revolute-Spherical (3RRS) wearable fingertip device for the rendering of stiffness information. It is composed of a static upper body and a mobile end-effector. The upper body is located on the nail side of the finger, supporting three small servo motors, and the mobile end-effector is in contact with the finger pulp. The two parts are connected by three articulated legs, actuated by the motors. The end-effector can move toward the users fingertip and rotate it to simulate contacts with arbitrarily-oriented surfaces. Moreover, a vibrotactile motor placed below the end-effector conveys vibrations to the fingertip. The proposed device weights 25 g for 35 x 50 x 48 mm dimensions. To test the effectiveness of our wearable haptic device and its level of wearability, we carried out two experiments, enrolling 30 human subjects in total. The first experiment tested the capability of our device in differentiating stiffness information, while the second one focused on evaluating its applicability in an immersive virtual reality scenario. Results showed the effectiveness of the proposed wearable solution, with a JND for stiffness of 208.5 +/- 17.2 N/m. Moreover, all subjects preferred the virtual interaction experience when provided with wearable cutaneous feedback, even if results also showed that subjects found our device still a bit difficult to use.

Abstract
During tool-mediated interaction with everyday objects, we experience kinesthetic forces and tactile sensations in the form of vibration and skin deformation at the fingerpad. Fingerpad skin deformation is caused by forces applied tangentially and normally to the fingerpad skin, resulting in tangential and normal skin displacement. We designed a device to convey 3-degree-of-freedom (DoF) force information to the user via skin deformation, and conducted two experiments to determine the devices effectiveness for force-feedback substitution and augmentation. For sensory substitution, participants used 1-DoF and 3-DoF skin deformation feedback to locate a feature in a 3-DoF virtual environment. Participants showed improved precision and shorter completion time when using 3-DoF compared to 1-DoF skin deformation feedback. For sensory augmentation, participants traced a path in space from an initial to a target location, while under guidance from force and/or skin deformation feedback. When force feedback was augmented with skin deformation, participants reduced their path-following error over the cases when force or skin deformation feedback are used separately. We conclude that 3-DoF skin deformation feedback is effective in substituting or augmenting force feedback. Such substitution or augmentation could be used when force feedback is unattainable or attenuated due to device limitations or system instability."

Abstract: WAVES, a Wearable Asymmetric Vibration Excitation System, is a novel wearable haptic device for presenting three dimensions of translation and rotation guidance cues. In contrast to traditional vibration feedback, which usually requires that users learn to interpret a binary cue, asymmetric vibrations have been shown to induce a pulling sensation in a desired direction. When attached to the fingers, a single voicecoil actuator presents a translation guidance cue and a pair of voicecoil actuators presents a rotation guidance cue. The directionality of mechanoreceptors in the skin led to our choice of the location and orientation of the actuators in order to elicit very strong sensations in certain directions. For example, users distinguished a ""left"" cue versus a ""right"" cue 94.5% of the time. When presented with one of six possible direction cues, users on average correctly identified the direction of translation cues 86.1% of the time and rotation cues 69.0% of the time.

Abstract
We propose a new type of tactile displays that drag a physical tactor across the skin in 2D. We call this skin drag. We demonstrate how this allows us to communicate geometric shapes or characters to users. The main benefit of our approach is that it simultaneously produces two types of stimuli, i.e., (1) it moves a tactile stimulus across skin locations and (2) it stretches the user's skin. Skin drag thereby combines the essential stimuli produced by vibrotactile and skin stretch. In our study, skin drag allowed participants to recognize tactile shapes significantly better than a vibrotactile array of comparable size. We present two arm-worn prototype devices that implement our concept."

Abstract: We present MagTics, a novel flexible and wearable haptic interface based on magnetically actuated bidirectional tactile pixels (taxels). MagTics' thin form factor and flexibility allows for rich haptic feedback in mobile settings. We propose a novel actuation mechanism based on bistable electromagnetic latching that combines high frame rate and holding force with low energy consumption and a soft and flexible form factor. We overcome limitations of traditional soft actuators by placing several hard actuation cells, driven by flexible printed electronics, in a soft 3D printed case. A novel EM-shielding prevents magnet-magnet interactions and allows for high actuator densities. A prototypical implementation comprising of 4 actuated pins on a 1.7 cm pitch, with 2 mm travel, and generating 160 mN to 200 mN of latching force is used to implement a number of compelling application scenarios including adding haptic and tactile display capabilities to wearable devices, to existing input devices and to provide localized haptic feedback in virtual reality. Finally, we report results of a psychophysical study, conducted to inform future developments and to identify possible application domains.

Abstract: The growing complexity of telemanipulation tasks calls for increased realism and intuitiveness of the interaction between the user and the master control. Humans perceive multiple haptic features of an object such as its stiffness, temperature, and shape, and rely on this multimodal information to achieve dexterous manipulation. However, to date, remote manipulators rarely provide haptic information to the operator. Moreover, current multimodal displays are often too rigid and bulky to be integrated into the manipulator. Thus, to improve the quality of teleoperation, there is a high demand for flexible devices that are capable of matching the skins curvature while delivering multimodal haptic information to the operator. In this paper, we present a flexible tactile display delivering tactile and thermal stimuli to the users skin. We propose a hybrid electromagnetic-pneumatic actuation to operate a 2 x 2 array of tactile cells. Each cell provides a repetitive stimulation with a force and an indentation that are above the human perception threshold for the finger, palm, and forearm. In addition, the temperature of the displays surface is controlled using a Peltier element attached to an air-cooled heatsink. By providing a reproducible cooling gradient, our display simulates common materials encountered in the daily environment. User study results show that (1) the tactile stimulation is perceived well and (2) the identification rates of objects simulated with the display were comparable to those obtained with real objects. Unlike previous devices, the thermal stimulation is delivered while the display is in constant contact with the users skin, a necessary requirement for teleoperation. These results demonstrate the potential of our device as a promising tactile display for providing haptic feedback in teleoperation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
The tactile display is a device which physically stimulates the human skin to reproduce the feel of touch. This paper presents a novel tactile display device driven by a dielectric elastomer actuator. The device adopts an indirect actuation method by using a rigid coupling, which aims to avoid direct contact of the human skin with the actuator. The rigid coupling is made of silicone to transmit the movement of the actuator to the touch layer located on the top surface of the coupling and provides the feeling of softness on contact. The device produces displacement about 350-140 mu m at 0.3-10 Hz, which meets frequency requirements for simulating the Merkel cells as well as Meissner corpuscle. The force to simulate the fingertips can be exerted over 44 mN. This work describes its design, analysis and fabrication method in details with its experimental evaluations."

Abstract: Flexible high-voltage thin-film transistors (HVTFTs) operating at more than 1 kV are integrated with compliant dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA) to create a flexible array of 16 independent actuators. To allow for high-voltage operation, the HVTFT implements a zinc-tin oxide channel, a thick dielectric stack, and an offset gate. At a source-drain bias of 1 kV, the HVTFT has a 20 mu A on-current at a gate voltage bias of 30 V. Their electrical characteristics enable the switching of DEAs which require drive voltages of over 1 kV, making control of an array simpler in comparison to the use of external high-voltage switching. These HVTFTs are integrated in a flexible haptic display consisting of a 4 x 4 matrix of DEAs and HVTFTs. Using a single 1.4 kV supply, each DEA is independently switched by its associated HVTFT, requiring only a 30 V gate voltage for full DEA deflection. The 4 x 4 display operates well even when bent to a 5 mm radius of curvature. By enabling DEA switching at low voltages, flexible metal-oxide HVTFTs enable complex flexible systems with dozens to hundreds of independent DEAs for applications in haptics, Braille displays, and soft robotics.

Abstract: The development of mobile haptics and multimodal designs has been strongly limited by the lack of enabling actuator technologies. This paper presents the properties of an electrostrive actuator technology for haptic feedback. By carefully tailoring material properties and actuator designing which can be integrating in devices, this technology should provide a realistic possibility of haptic design with considerable latitude. Haptic characteristics are described and realized and their impact on haptic design is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel interactive system that mutually copies adjacent 3D environments optically and physically. The system realizes mutual user interactions through haptics without wearing any devices. A realistic volumetric image is displayed using a pair of micro-mirror array plates (MMAPs). The MMAP transmissively reflects the rays from an object, and a pair of them reconstructs the floating aerial image of the object. Our system can optically copy adjacent environments based on this technology. Haptic feedback is also given by using an airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD). Converged ultrasound can give force feedback in midair. Based on the optical characteristics of the MMAPs, the cloned image and the user share an identical coordinate system. When a user touches the transferred clone image, the system gives force feedback so that the user can feel the mechanical contact and reality of the floating image.

Abstract: Studies of the stimulating effect of ultrasound as a tactile display have recently become more intensive in the haptic domain. In this paper, we present the design, development, and evaluation of Haptogram; a system designed to provide point-cloud tactile display via acoustic radiation pressure. A tiled 2-D array of ultrasound transducers is used to produce a focal point that is animated to produce arbitrary 2-D and 3-D tactile shapes. The switching speed is very high, so that humans feel the distributed points simultaneously. The Haptogram system comprises a software component and a hardware component. The software component enables users to author and/or select a tactile object, create a point-cloud representation, and generate a sequence of focal points to drive the hardware. The hardware component comprises a tiled 2-D array of ultrasound transducers, each driven by an FPGA. A quantitative analysis is conducted to measure the Haptogram ability to display various tactile shapes, including a single point, 2-D shapes (a straight line and a circle) and a 3-D object (a hemisphere). Results show that all displayed tactile objects are perceivable by the human skin (an average of 2.65 kPa for 200 focal points). A usability study is also conducted to evaluate the ability of humans to recognize 2-D shapes. Results show that the recognition rate was well above the chance level (average of 59.44% and standard deviation of 12.75%) while the recognition time averaged 13.87 s (standard deviation of 3.92 s).

Abstract: Shape-changing interfaces are a category of device capable of altering their form in order to facilitate communication of information. In this work, we present a shape-changing device that has been designed for navigation assistance. `The Animotus (previously, `The Haptic Sandwich), resembles a cube with an articulated upper half that is able to rotate and extend (translate) relative to the bottom half, which is fixed in the users grasp. This rotation and extension, generally felt via the users fingers, is used to represent heading and proximity to navigational targets. The device is intended to provide an alternative to screen or audio based interfaces for visually impaired, hearing impaired, deafblind, and sighted pedestrians. The motivation and design of the haptic device is presented, followed by the results of a navigation experiment that aimed to determine the role of each device DOF, in terms of facilitating guidance. An additional device, `The Haptic Taco, which modulated its volume in response to target proximity (negating directional feedback), was also compared. Results indicate that while the heading (rotational) DOF benefited motion efficiency, the proximity (translational) DOF benefited velocity. Combination of the two DOF improved overall performance. The volumetric Taco performed comparably to the Animotus extension DOF.

Abstract: Current mobile devices do not leverage the rich haptic channel of information that our hands can sense, and instead focus primarily on touch based graphical interfaces. Our goal is to enrich the user experience of these devices through bidirectional haptic and tactile interactions (display and control) around the edge of hand-held devices. We propose a novel type of haptic interface, a Haptic Edge Display, consisting of actuated pins on the side of a display, to form a linear array of tactile pixels (taxels). These taxels are implemented using small piezoelectric actuators, which can be made cheaply and have ideal characteristics for mobile devices. We developed two prototype Haptic Edge Displays, one with 24 actuated pins (3.75mm in pitch) and a second with 40 pins (2.5mm in pitch). This paper describes several novel haptic interactions for the Haptic Edge Display including dynamic physical affordances, shape display, non-dominant hand interactions, and also in-pocket ""pull"" style haptic notifications. In a laboratory experiment we investigated the limits of human perception for Haptic Edge Displays, measuring the just-noticeable difference for pin width and height changes for both in-hand and simulated in-pocket conditions.

Abstract: Human-machine haptic interaction is typically detected by variations in friction, roughness, hardness, and temperature, which combines to create sensation of surface texture change. Most of the current technologies work to simulate changes in tactile perception (via electrostatic, lateral force fields, vibration motors, etc.) without creating actual topographical transformations. This makes it challenging to provide localized feedback. Here, a new concept for on-demand surface texture augmentation that is capable of physically forming local topographic features in any predesigned pattern is demonstrated. The transparent, flexible, integrable device comprises of a hybrid electrode system with conductive hydrogel, silver nanowires, and conductive polymers with acrylic elastomer as the dielectric layer. Desired surface textures can be controlled by a predesigned pattern of electrodes, which operates as independent or interconnected actuators. Surface features with up to a height of 0.155 mm can be achieved with a transformation time of less than a second for a device area of 18 cm(2). High transparency levels of 76% are achieved due to the judicious choice of the electrode and the active elastomer layer. The capability of localized and controlled deformations makes this system highly useful for applications such as display touchscreens, touchpads, braille displays, on-demand buttons, and microfluidic devices.

Abstract: An electroactive and actuator made of knitted polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel fabric is proposed herein. This haptic actuator consists of an upper layer, a lower layer, and fabric made by twisting long and slender PVC gel strings. The PVC gel fabric changes its shape according to the input voltage waveform, and exerts an electrostatic force between the upper and lower layers. When the applied voltage is removed, the PVC gel fabric rapidly restores to its initial configuration. Consequently, these effects generate vibrations that are sufficiently strong for human perception. In this paper, we conducted quantitative experiments to investigate the performance of our soft haptic actuator using an accelerometer and a laser scanning vibrometer. Furthermore, we performed a perceptual evaluation and the results indicate that our proposed actuator can stimulate the human skin with sufficient perceptual strength.

Abstract
Tactile devices containing many actuators within are being sutured using electroactive polymers. This innovation forms the basis of hand-like tactile feedback in emerging smart robotic manipulation. Here, we introduce low power consuming modified reduced graphene oxide embedded cellulose acetate composite of high flexibility and conformability to surfaces made by simple and low cost synthesis methods, which thus points towards simple read-out electronics. The material performance was evaluated based on various actuation conditions in terms of electrical potential, bias voltage, temperature and frequency. The actuator vibrating at various frequencies with faster response time illustrates a range of haptic feedbacks to users, which can be used in braille display devices. Excellent repeatability of the haptic actuation process was also noticed."

Abstract: An electroactive and transparent haptic interface having a rectangular void pattern creates tunable surface textures by controlling the wavelength and amplitude of independent void-lines. To make an active tactile surface, the transparent haptic interface employs a silver nanowire (AgNW) electrode to be compliant with the deformed elastomer surface. Here, the dielectric elastomer is newly blended with polydimethylsiloxane and Ecoflex pre-polymer to simultaneously control the mechanical stiffness and transparency. The relative resistance of the AgNW electrode on a single void line is nearly unchanged under bending test, confirming the high stretchability and conductivity of the nanowire-networked electrode. The optical transparencies are 92-85%, depending on the ratio of the Ecoflex solution. Transparency values decreas by 7 and 16% after coating with AgNWs at densities of 30 and 140 mg m(-2), respectively. Using EP31, the void line is deformed by 90 mu m under a field intensity of 13.0 V mu m(-1). The haptic surface is successfully controlled by applying voltage, which produces four different surface textures, from relatively smooth to rough feeling, depending on the distance between deformed void lines. This haptic interface can be applied to diverse display systems as an external add-on screen and will help to realize programmable surface textures in the future.

Abstract: Dielectric elastomer actuators exhibit an unusual combination of large displacements, moderate bandwidth, low power consumption, and mechanical impedance comparable with human skin, making them attractive for haptic devices. In this article, we propose a wearable haptic communication device based on a two-by-two array of dielectric elastomer linear actuators. We briefly describe the architecture of the actuators and their mechanical and electrical integration into a wearable armband. We then characterize the actuators force, displacement, and thermal properties in a bench-top configuration. We also report on the power and drive circuit design. Finally, we perform a set of preliminary perception evaluations on participants using our haptic device, including detection threshold tests and identification tests for locations and directions on the forearm. Human testing with individual actuators demonstrates that the broadband actuation can be easily perceived on the forearm, providing the basis for both the development of a wearable actuator array and its use in more extensive perception evaluation as described herein.

Abstract: Electroactive soft actuators and bioinspired artificial muscles have received burgeoning interest as essential components in future electronic devices such as soft haptic-feedback systems, human-friendly wearable electronics, and active biomedical devices. However, important challenging issues including fast response time, ultralow input power, robust operation in harsh environments, high-resolution controllability, and cost-effectiveness remain to be resolved for more practical applications. Here, an electroionic antagonistic artificial muscle is reported based on hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon (HPNC) electrodes derived from a microporous poly(triazine-triptycene) organic framework (PtztpOF). The HPNC, which exhibits hierarchically micro-and mesoporous structures, high specific capacitance of 330 F g(-1) in aqueous solution, large specific surface area of 830.46 m(2) g(-1), and graphitic nitrogen doping, offers high electrical conductivity of 0.073 MS m(-1) and outstanding volumetric capacitance of 10.4 MF m(-3). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a novel electroionic antagonistic muscle based on HPNC electrodes successfully displays extremely reliable and large bending deformations and long-term durability under ultralow input voltages. Therefore, microporous polymer or covalent organic frameworks can be applied to provide significant improvements in electroactive artificial muscles, which can play key roles as technological advances toward bioinspired actuating devices required for next-generation soft and wearable electronics.

Abstract
Artificial muscles may accelerate the development of robotics, haptics, and prosthetics. Although advances in polymer-based actuators have delivered unprecedented strengths, producing these devices at scale with tunable dimensions remains a challenge. We applied a high-throughput iterative fiber-drawing technique to create strain-programmable artificial muscles with dimensions spanning three orders of magnitude. These fiber-based actuators are thermally and optically controllable, can lift more than 650 times their own weight, and withstand strains of >1000%. Integration of conductive nanowire meshes within these fiber-based muscles offers piezoresistive strain feedback and demonstrates long-term resilience across >10(5) deformation cycles. The scalable dimensions of these fiber-based actuators and their strength and responsiveness may extend their impact from engineering fields to biomedical applications."

Abstract
High-performance electoactive artificial muscles with biofriendly, biodegradable, and biocompatible functionalities have attracted enormous attention in the era of human friendly electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft haptic devices, and implantable or disposal biomedical devices. Here, a high-fidelity bioelectronic soft actuator is reported based on biofriendly 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical-oxidized bacterial cellulose (TOBC), chemically modified graphene, and ionic liquid [EMIM][BF4] as plasticizer, thereby realizing large deformable, faster, biodegradable, air working, and highly durable TOBC-IL-G muscular actuator. Especially, the TOBC-IL-G(0.10 wt%) membrane shows a dramatic increment of the ionic conductivity up to 120%, of specific capacitance up to 95%, of tensile modulus up to 63%, and of tensile strength up to 60%, for TOBC-IL, resulting in 2.3 times larger bending deformation without serious back-relaxation phenomena. The developed high-performance and durable bioelectronic muscular actuator can be a promising candidate for satisfying the tight requirements of human-related bioengineering as well as biomimetic robotics and biomedical active devices.

Abstract
Upcoming human-related applications such as soft wearable electronics, flexible haptic systems, and active bio-medical devices will require bio-friendly actuating materials. Here, we report a soft biomolecule actuator based on carboxylated bacterial cellulose (CBC), ionic liquid (IL), and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes. Soft and biocompatible polymer-IL composites were prepared via doping of CBC with ILs. The highly conductive PEDOT: PSS layers were deposited on both sides of the CBC-IL membranes by a dip-coating technique to yield a sandwiched actuator system. Ionic conductivity and ionic exchange capacity of the CBC membrane can be increased up to 22.8 times and 1.5 times compared with pristine bacterial cellulose (BC), respectively, resulting in 8 times large bending deformation than the pure BC actuators with metallic electrodes in an open air environment. The developed CBC-IL actuators show significant progress in the development of biocompatible and soft actuating materials with quick response, low operating voltage and comparatively large bending deformation."

Abstract: A high-resolution flexible active skin with a matrix of 32 x 24 individually addressable tactile pixels on a 4 mm pitch is reported, based on shape memory polymer (SMP) actuators. The intrinsic multistable nature of SMPs, and their more than 100-fold variation in stiffness over a narrow temperature range, enables dense arrays of actuators exhibiting simultaneously large strokes and high holding forces. The control challenge of addressing a very large number of soft actuators is solved by patterning an array of miniature stretchable heaters on a thin SMP membrane, so that one single pneumatic supply is sufficient to rapidly and selectively reconfigure any or all elements. The device consists of a 40 mu m thick SMP layer, on which 32 x 24 stretchable heaters are integrated, interconnected by a flexible printed circuit board, and bonded to a stretchable 3D-printed pneumatic chamber. Each taxel can be individually controlled via row/column addressing, and requires 2.5 s to latch to a different state. The active skin weighs only 55 g and is 2 mm thick. More than 99% of the 768 taxels are fully functional, with a lifetime in excess of 20 000 cycles. This architecture enables applications in haptic displays, active camouflage, biomimetic robots, microfluidics, and new human machine interfaces.

Abstract: This paper proposes a miniature haptic ring that can display touch/pressure and shearing force to the users fingerpad. For practical use and wider application of the device, it is developed with the aim of achieving high wearability and mobility/portability as well as cutaneous force feedback functionality. A main body of the device is designed as a ring-shaped lightweight structure with a simple driving mechanism, and thin shape memory alloy (SMA) wires having high energy density are applied as actuating elements. Also, based on a band-type wireless control unit including a wireless data communication module, the whole device could be realized as a wearable mobile haptic device system. These features enable the device to take diverse advantages on functional performances and to provide users with significant usability. In this work, the proposed miniature haptic ring is systematically designed, and its working performances are experimentally evaluated with a fabricated functional prototype. The experimental results obviously demonstrate that the proposed device exhibits higher force-toweight ratio than conventional finger-wearable haptic devices for cutaneous force feedback. Also, it is investigated that operational performances of the device are strongly influenced by electro-thermomechanical behaviors of the SMA actuator. In addition to the experiments for performance evaluation, we conduct a preliminary user test to assess practical feasibility and usability based on users qualitative feedback.

Abstract: This work aims to demonstrate and explain a nearly century old electrostatic haptic effect in human fingertips, which has since gone unreported. This effect, based on the original work of Johnsen and Rahbek [1], as well as research on electrostatic chucking devices [2], is capable of producing electrostatic forces on the finger an order of magnitude greater than those previously reported in literature. It is also capable of working with DC excitation, an aspect which stands out against previous reports which utilize purely AC excitation. This work also proposes a unified force model for this effect, drawn from electrostatic chuck research, and resolves this model with those in previous reports. We briefly discuss the background and specifics of the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, and include measurements made with our own electroadhesive surface and experimental apparatus. Finally, we discuss how this model fits in with previous observations, and its implications going forward.

Abstract: In the field of micromanipulation, there exists a pressing need for flexible manipulation systems that facilitate the intuitive performance of a range of micro-scale tasks. Parallel or serial chains of compliant flexure mechanisms, driven by piezoelectric actuators (PEAS) are ideal microposidoners for these tasks. They offer smooth, continuous motion with subnanometric accuracy. However, cross-coupling and assembly errors limit their tracking precision when multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are used, and current manufacturing techniques limit mechanisms to planar designs. This paper presents a methodology which enables a human operator to precisely control the motion of a multi-DOF piezo-actuated flexure mechanism with haptic feedback. An experimental master-slave manipulator is investigated, consisting of a 4-DOF hybrid parallel-serial slave mechanism. Internal sensors and kinematic information enable the estimation of slave position and orientation. From this, a bilateral haptic controller has been developed to compensate for coupling and assembly errors, and PEA hysteresis nonlinearities present in the slave mechanism. Master mechanism inverse dynamics control is implemented to offset master mechanism inertia, whilst passivity control guarantees stability. Experimental analysis demonstrates precisions of approximately 30 nm can be achieved during low speed interactions, with intuitive environmental force feedback. With appropriate choice of end-effector, the system could be used for tasks such as the assembly of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

These small-scale clutches were designed in our lab, and their evaluation were reported previously [1], [2]. MRF-based actuators exhibit superior characteristics, which can significantly contribute to transparency and stability of haptic devices. Based on these actuators, a distributed antagonistic configuration is used to develop the 2-DoF haptic interface. This device is incorporated in a master-slave teleoperation setup intended for medical percutaneous interventions and soft-tissue palpation. Preliminary studies on the stability and transparency of the haptic interface in this setup using phantom and ex vivo samples show the great potential of MRF-based actuators for integration in haptic devices that require reliable, safe, accurate, highly transparent, and stable force reflection.

Abstract: Smart materials such as magnetorheological fluids (MRF) offer an interesting medium to present viscoelastic cues in haptic displays as changes in the magnetic field are rapid, reversible and controllable. These interfaces have been evaluated in a number of medical and surgical simulators where they can provide cues regarding the viscoelastic properties of tissues. The present experiment determined whether eight different shapes could be identified reliably with a MRF haptic display and compared the information transfer (IT) associated with this type of display with that achieved by other forms of haptic communication. The overall performance of participants at identifying the shapes was good with a mean score of 70% correct and an IT of 2.13 bits. This type of display shows promise as a training tool for simulating tissue properties.

Abstract
Shape changing interfaces give physical shapes to digital data so that users can feel and manipulate data with their hands and bodies. However, physical objects in our daily life not only have shape but also various material properties. In this paper, we propose an interaction technique to represent material properties using shape changing interfaces. Specifically, by integrating the multi-modal sensation techniques of haptics, our approach builds a perceptive model for the properties of deformable materials in response to direct manipulation.

As a proof-of-concept prototype, we developed preliminary physics algorithms running on pin-based shape displays. The system can create computationally variable properties of deformable materials that are visually and physically perceivable. In our experiments, users identify three deformable material properties (flexibility, elasticity and viscosity) through direct touch interaction with the shape display and its dynamic movements. In this paper, we describe interaction techniques, our implementation, future applications and evaluation on how users differentiate between specific properties of our system. Our research shows that shape changing interfaces can go beyond simply displaying shape allowing for rich embodied interaction and perceptions of rendered materials with the hands and body."

Abstract: Vibrotactile actuation is typically used to deliver buzzing sensations. But if vibrotactile actuation is tightly coupled to users actions, it can be used to create much richer haptic experiences. It is not well understood, however, how this coupling should be done or which vibrotactile parameters create which experiences. To investigate how actuation parameters relate to haptic experiences, we built a physical slider with minimal native friction, a vibrotactile actuator and an integrated position sensor. By vibrating the slider as it is moved, we create an experience of texture between the sliding element and its track. We conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how granularity, amplitude and timbre relate to the experiences of roughness, adhesiveness, sharpness and bumpiness. We found that amplitude influences the strength of the perceived texture, while variations in granularity and timbre create distinct experiences. Our study underlines the importance of action in haptic perception and suggests strategies for deploying such tightly coupled feedback in everyday devices.

Abstract: ReFlex is a flexible smartphone with bend input and active haptic feedback. ReFlex's features allow the introduction of sensations such as friction or resistance. We report results from an experiment using ReFlex in a targeting task, as well as initial users' reactions to the prototype. We explore both absolute and relative tactile haptic feedback, paired with two types of bend input mappings: position-control and rate-control. We observed that position-controlled cursors paired well with relative bend feedback, while rate-controlled cursors paired well with absolute bend feedback to indicate targets. We also explored an eyes-free condition. Results suggest that while eyes-free, haptic feedback conditions were more error-prone than visual-only conditions, the size of the error was relatively small, and users were able to complete the task in all cases. We present two application scenarios that take advantage of the unique input and output modalities of ReFlex and discuss its potential for within document navigation.

Abstract: Robust haptic devices that can convey the entire spectrum of human touch perception are necessary to afford realistic haptic experiences. For vivid and immersive interaction, a combination of both tactile and kinesthetic information must be presented to users. While vibrotactile feedback has become ubiquitous in todays handheld devices, traditional kinesthetic actuators present significant challenges to miniaturization. Moreover, only limited success has been achieved in developing haptic actuators capable of conveying both tactile and kinesthetic sensations for small consumer electronics. Therefore, this study presents a compact actuator based on electrorheological (ER) fluid for generating a wide range of concurrent kinesthetic and tactile feedback. The design focus for the proposed actuator is to activate multiple operating modes of ER fluid to maximize the force generated by the actuator within a given small size constraint. To this end, the design incorporated two ground electrodes (a stationary ring electrode and a movable electrode attached to a spring element) for tuning the fluids yield stress in both flow and squeeze modes. After fabricating a prototype actuator, testing was performed with a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and an accelerometer to evaluate its ability to produce a wide range of kinesthetic feedback, as well as distinct vibrotactile feedback up to the limit of human perception. The results of kinesthetic testing indicate that the actuator can generate large forces (6.2 N maximum at 4 kV) at rates greater than the just-noticeable difference, indicating that the actuator can convey a wide range of kinesthetic sensations. Tactile evaluation using DMA and the processed acceleration response demonstrated that the actuator can generate both low and high frequency (up to 300 Hz) vibrotactile sensations at perceivably high intensity.

Abstract: We present an investigation of mechanically-actuated hand-held controllers that render the shape of virtual objects through physical shape displacement, enabling users to feel 3D surfaces, textures, and forces that match the visual rendering. We demonstrate two such controllers, NormalTouch and TextureTouch. Both controllers are tracked with 6 DOF and produce spatially-registered haptic feedback to a users finger. NormalTouch haptically renders object surfaces and provides force feedback using a tiltable and extrudable platform. TextureTouch renders the shape of virtual objects including detailed surface structure through a 4x4 matrix of actuated pins. By moving our controllers around in space while keeping their finger on the actuated platform, users obtain the impression of a much larger 3D shape by cognitively integrating output sensations over time. Our evaluation compares the effectiveness of our controllers with the two defacto standards in Virtual Reality controllers: device vibration and visual feedback only. We find that haptic feedback significantly increases the accuracy of VR interaction, most effectively by rendering high-fidelity shape output as in the case of our controllers. Participants also generally found NormalTouch and TextureTouch realistic in conveying the sense of touch for a variety of 3D objects.
