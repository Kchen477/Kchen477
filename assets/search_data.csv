Such a force, affected by complex physical variations and collisions, is difficult to properly simulate using current force feedback methods. Therefore, we propose ElastOscillation on a virtual reality (VR) controller to provide 3D multilevel force feedback for damped oscillation to enhance VR experiences. ElastOscillation consists of a proxy, six elastic bands and DC motors. It leverages the motors to control the bands' elasticity to restrain the movement of the proxy, which is connected with the bands. Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in corresponding ranges of movement. The users then perceive the force from oscillation at different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. We conducted a force perception study to understand users' distinguishability for perceiving oscillation forces in 1D and 2D movement, respectively. Based on the results, we performed a VR experience study to show that the force feedback provided by ElastOscillation enhances VR realism.",Mass redistribution,Shaking,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

We present the concept and implementation of Drag:on, an ungrounded Shape-changing VR controller that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag, i.e. air resistance, and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow occurring at the controller during interaction. By dynamically adjusting its surface area, the controller changes the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. In a user study, we found that Drag:on can provide distinguishable levels of haptic feedback. Our prototype increases the haptic realism in VR compared to standard controllers and when rotated or swung improves the perception of virtual resistance. By this, Drag:on provides haptic feedback suitable for rendering different virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state.","Shape,Mass",Shaking,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

Even though the Shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (VR), it is difficult to design VR controllers for rendering desired Shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and Shape perception. We propose Transcalibur, which is a hand-held VR controller that can render a 2D Shape by changing its mass properties on a 2D planar area. We built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived Shapes. This enables Transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing Shape perception based on complex illusory effects. Our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired Shapes in a virtual environment.","Shape,Mass",Unsupported holding,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

This concept combines actuators known from active haptics and physical proxies known from passive haptics to construct proxies that automatically adapt their passive haptic feedback. We describe the concept behind our ungrounded weight-shifting DPHF proxy Shifty and the implementation of our prototype. We then investigate how Shifty can, by automatically changing its internal weight distribution, enhance the user's perception of virtual objects interacted with in two experiments. In a first experiment, we show that Shifty can enhance the perception of virtual objects changing in Shape, especially in length and thickness. Here, Shifty was shown to increase the user's fun and perceived realism significantly, compared to an equivalent passive haptic proxy. In a second experiment, Shifty is used to pick up virtual objects of different virtual weights. The results show that Shifty enhances the perception of weight and thus the perceived realism by adapting its kinesthetic feedback to the picked-up virtual object. In the same experiment, we additionally show that specific combinations of haptic, visual and auditory feedback during the pick-up interaction help to compensate for visual-haptic mismatch perceived during the shifting process.

Recently, with consumers pushing forward with untethered VR, researchers turned away from solutions based on bulky hardware (e.g., exoskeletons and robotic arms) and started exploring smaller portable or wearable devices. However, when it comes to rendering inertial forces, such as when moving a heavy object around or when interacting with objects with unique mass properties, current ungrounded force feedback devices are unable to provide quick weight shifting sensations that can realistically simulate weight changes over 2D surfaces. In this paper we introduce Aero-plane, a force-feedback handheld controller based on two miniature jet propellers that can render shifting weights of up to 14 N within 0.3 seconds. Through two user studies we: (1) characterize the users' ability to perceive and correctly recognize different motion paths on a virtual plane while using our device; and, (2) tested the level of realism and immersion of the controller when used in two VR applications (a rolling ball on a plane, and using kitchen tools of different Shapes and sizes). Lastly, we present a set of applications that further explore different usage cases and alternative form-factors for our device.",Force/motion,Shaking,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,Fluidic Mechs

The aim is to enable eyes-free usage and avoid distracting the user from the environment. Field studies where participants had to fulfill given navigation tasks, have found these techniques to be efficient and beneficial in terms of distraction. But it is not yet clear whether these findings will replicate in in-situ usage. We, therefore, developed a Google Maps-like navigation application that incorporates interaction techniques proposed in previous work. The application was published for free on the Android Market and so people were able to use it as a navigation system in their everyday life.

Though most prior works focus on force feedback on fingers, the haptic emulation of grasping a 3D Shape requires the sensation of touch using the entire hand. Hence, we present Pop-up Prop on Palm (PuPoP), a light-weight pneumatic Shape-proxy interface worn on the palm that pops several airbags up with predefined primitive Shapes for grasping. When a user's hand encounters a virtual object, an airbag of appropriate Shape, ready for grasping, is inflated by way of the use of air pumps; the airbag then deflates when the object is no longer in play. Since PuPoP is a physical prop, it can provide the full sensation of touch to enhance the sense of realism for VR object manipulation. For this paper, we first explored the design and implementation of PuPoP with multiple Shape structures. We then conducted two user studies to further understand its applicability. The first study shows that, when in conflict, visual sensation tends to dominate over touch sensation, allowing a prop with a fixed size to represent multiple virtual objects with similar sizes. The second study compares PuPoP with controllers and free-hand manipulation in two VR applications. The results suggest that utilization of dynamically-changing PuPoP, when grasped by users in line with the Shapes of virtual objects, enhances enjoyment and realism. We believe that PuPoP is a simple yet effective way to convey haptic Shapes in VR.",Shape,Enclosure,Whole proximate objects,Grounding-on-multiple-body-parts,Grasped,Existing devices,Fluidic Mechs

This is achieved by modulating friction forces between the user's finger and the touch screen, instead of physically moving the touch surface. We proposed that the percept of a 3D bump is created when local gradients of the rendered virtual surface are mapped to lateral friction forces. To validate this approach, we first establish a psychophysical model that relates the perceived friction force to the controlled voltage applied to the tactile feedback device. We then use this model to demonstrate that participants are three times more likely to prefer gradient force profiles than other commonly used rendering profiles. Finally, we present a generalized algorithm and conclude the paper with a set of applications using our tactile rendering technology.",Fine roughness,Lateral motion,Partial proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

Evidently, such interfaces require flexibility and conformity without losing their functionality even on rigid surfaces. Although there have been various research efforts in creating tactile feedback to improve various haptic interfaces and master slave manipulators, we are yet to see a comprehensive device that can both supply vibratory actuation and tactile sensing. This paper describes a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA)-based skin prototype that allows bidirectional tactile information transfer to facilitate simpler and responsive wearable interface. We describe the design and fabrication of a 1.4 mm-thick vibratory SPA skin that is integrated with piezoelectric sensors. We examine in detail the mechanical performance compared to the SPA model and the sensitivity of the sensors for the application in vibrotactile feedback. Experimental findings show that this ultra-thin SPA and the unique integration process of the discrete lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based piezoelectric sensors achieve high resolution of soft contact sensing as well as accurate control on vibrotactile feedback by closing the control loop.",NA,NA,Vibration,NA,NA,Existing devices,NA

A hollow silicone membrane is molded into an array of thin cells, each filled with coffee grounds such that adjusting the vacuum level in any individual cell rapidly switches it between flexible and rigid states. The array clamps over a pressure-regulated air chamber with internal mechanisms designed to pin the nodes between cells at any given height. Various sequences of cell vacuuming, node pinning, and chamber pressurization allow the surface to balloon into a variety of Shapes. Experiments were performed to expand existing physical models of jamming at the inter-particle level to define the rheological characteristics of jammed systems from a macroscopic perspective, relevant to force-displacement interactions that would be experienced by human users. Force-displacement data show that a jammed cell in compression fits a Maxwell model and a cell deflected in the center while supported only at the edges fits a Zener model, each with stiffness and damping parameters that increase at higher levels of applied vacuum. This provides framework to tune and control the mechanical properties of a jamming haptic interface. ","Hardness, Shape",NA,Partial proximate objects,NA,Encountered,Existing devices,NA

Motions such as flying, diving or floating in outer space generate kinesthetic forces onto our body which impede movement and are currently not represented in VR. We simulate those kinesthetic forces by attaching flywheels to the users head, leveraging the gyroscopic effect of resistance when changing the spinning axis of rotation. GyroVR is an ungrounded, wireless and self contained device allowing the user to freely move inside the virtual environment. The generic Shape allows to attach it to different positions on the users body. We evaluated the impact of GyroVR onto different mounting positions on the head (back and front) in terms of immersion, enjoyment and simulator sickness. Our results show, that attaching GyroVR onto the users head (front of the Head Mounted Display (HMD)) resulted in the highest level of immersion and enjoyment and therefore can be built into future VR HMDs, enabling kinesthetic forces in VR.

Pull-Ups actuates the user's body to move up to 15 cm by pulling his or her hands using a pair of pneumatic artificial muscle groups. Our studies informed the discernible kinesthetic force feedbacks that were then exploited for the design of kinesthetic force feedback in three physical activities: kitesurfing, paragliding, and space invader. Our final study on user experiences suggested that a passive suspension kit alone added substantially to users' perceptions of realism and enjoyment (all above neutral) with passive physical support, while sufficient active feedback can further level them up. In addition, we found that both passive and active feedback of the suspension kit significantly reduced motion sickness in simulated kitesurfing and paragliding compared to when no suspension kit (thus no feedback) was provided. This work suggests that a passive suspension kit is cost-effective as a home exercise kit, while active feedback can further level up user experience, though at the cost of the installation (e.g., an air compressor in our prototype).",Haptic effects,NA,Force/movements across joints,Grounding-off-body,Grasped,Existing devices,NA

The Haptic Turk system, for example, used four human actuators to lift and push a virtual reality user: TurkDeck used ten human actuators to place and animate props for a single user. While the experience of human actuators was decent, it was still inferior to the experience these people could have had, had they participated as a user. In this paper, we address this issue by making everyone a user. We introduce mutual human actuation, a version of human actuation that works without dedicated human actuators. The key idea is to run pairs of users at the same time and have them provide human actuation to each other. Our system, Mutual Turk, achieves this by (1) offering shared props through which users can exchange forces while obscuring the fact that there is a human on the other side, and (2) synchronizing the two users' timelines such that their way of manipulating the shared props is consistent across both virtual worlds. We demonstrate mutual human actuation with an example experience in which users pilot kites though storms, tug fish out of ponds, are pummeled by hail, battle monsters, hop across chasms, push loaded carts, and ride in moving vehicles.

TurkDeck produces the haptic sensation using props, i.e., when users touch or manipulate an object in the virtual world, they simultaneously also touch or manipulate a corresponding object in the physical world. Unlike previous work on prop-based virtual reality, however, TurkDeck allows creating arbitrarily large virtual worlds in finite space and using a finite set of physical props. The key idea behind TurkDeck is that it creates these physical representations on the fly by making a group of human workers present and operate the props only when and where the user can actually reach them. TurkDeck manages these so-called ""human actuators"" by displaying visual instructions that tell the human actuators when and where to place props and how to actuate them. We demonstrate TurkDeck at the example of an immersive 300m2 experience in 25m2 physical space. We show how to simulate a wide range of physical objects and effects, including walls, doors, ledges, steps, beams, switches, stompers, portals, zip lines, and wind.

However, resistive force continuously changes due to users' movements while impact instantly occurs when an event triggers it. These feedback are still not realistically provided by current VR haptic methods. In this paper, a wearable device, ElasticVR, which consists of an elastic band, servo motors and mechanical brakes, is proposed to provide the continuously-changing resistive force and instantly-occurring impact upon the user's hand to enhance VR realism. By changing two physical properties, length and extension distance, of the elastic band, ElasticVR provides multilevel resistive force with no delay and impact with little delay, respectively, for realistic and versatile VR applications. A force perception study was performed to observe users' force distinguishability of the resistive force and impact, and the prototype was built based on its results. A VR experience study further proves that the resistive force and impact from ElasticVR both outperform those from current approaches in realism. Applications using ElasticVR are also demonstrated.","Hardness, Force/motion",Pressure,Force/movements across joints,Grounding-on-multiple-body-parts,Worn,"Electromagnetic Mechs,Material-flexibility-based Mechs","String-based and rod-based Mechs, NA"

We harness the resulting braking force to rapidly render on-demand kinesthetic feedback. The electrostatic brake is mounted onto the the index finger and thumb via modular 3D printed articulated guides which allow the metal strips to glide smoothly. Cutaneous feedback is provided via piezo actuators at the fingertips. We demonstrate that our approach can provide rich haptic feedback under dexterous articulation of the user's hands and provides effective haptic feedback across a variety of different grasps. A controlled experiment indicates that DextrES improves the grasping precision for different types of virtual objects.

These controllers are grounded to the user's hand and can only manipulate objects through arm and wrist motions, not using the dexterity of their fingers as they would in real life. In this paper, we present TORC, a rigid haptic controller that renders virtual object characteristics and behaviors such as texture and Hardness. Users hold and squeeze TORC using their thumb and two fingers and interact with virtual objects by sliding their thumb on TORC's trackpad. During the interaction, vibrotactile motors produce sensations to each finger that represent the haptic feel of squeezing, shearing or turning an object. Our evaluation showed that using TORC, participants could manipulate virtual objects more precisely (e.g., position and rotate objects in 3D) than when using a conventional VR controller.

We present Grabity, a wearable haptic device designed to simulate kinesthetic pad opposition grip forces and weight for grasping virtual objects in VR. The device is mounted on the index finger and thumb and enables precision grasps with a wide range of motion. A unidirectional brake creates rigid grasping force feedback. Two voice coil actuators create virtual force tangential to each finger pad through asymmetric skin deformation. These forces can be perceived as gravitational and inertial forces of virtual objects. The rotational orientation of the voice coil actuators is passively aligned with the real direction of gravity through a revolute joint, causing the virtual forces to always point downward. This paper evaluates the performance of Grabity through two user studies, finding promising ability to simulate different levels of weight with convincing object rigidity. The first user study shows that Grabity can convey various magnitudes of weight and force sensations to users by manipulating the amplitude of the asymmetric vibration. The second user study shows that users can differentiate different weights in a virtual environment using Grabity.","Hardness, Size,Mass","Pressure,Unsupported holding",Force/movements across joints,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

A servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. Using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement.

Instead, CapstanCrunch¬ integrates a friction-based capstan-plus-cord variable-resistance brake mechanism that is dynamically controlled by a small inter-nal motor. The capstan mechanism magnifies the motor's force by a factor of around 40 as an output resistive force. Compared to active force control devices, it is low cost, low electrical power, robust, safe, fast and quiet, while providing high force control to user interaction. We describe the de-sign and implementation of CapstanCrunch and demon-strate its use in a series of VR scenarios.

The SAFE Glove is a wireless and self-contained mechatronic system that mounts over the dorsum of a bare hand and provides haptic force feedback to each finger. The glove is adaptable to a wide variety of finger sizes without constraining the range of motion. This makes it possible to accurately and comfortably track the complex motion of the finger and thumb joints associated with common movements of hand functions, including grip and release patterns. The glove can be wirelessly linked to a computer for displaying and recording the hand status through 3D Graphical User Interface (GUI) in real-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAFE Glove is capable of reliably modeling hand kinematics, measuring finger motion and assisting hand grasping motion.

Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand.

In this paper we present a novel wearable cutaneous fingertip device with 3 degrees of freedom. It is composed of two parallel platforms: the upper body is fixed on the back of the finger, housing three small servo motors, and the mobile end-effector is in contact with the volar surface of the fingertip. The two platforms are connected by three articulated legs, actuated by the motors in order to move the mobile platform toward the users fingertip and re-angle it to simulate contacts with arbitrarily oriented surfaces. Each leg is composed of two rigid links, connected to each other and then to the platforms, according to a RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical) kinematic chain. With respect to other similar cable-driven devices presented in the literature, this device solves the indeterminacy due to the underactuation of the platform. This work presents the main design steps for the development of the wearable display, along with its kinematics, quasi-static modeling, and control. In particular, we analyzed the relationship between device performance and its main geometrical parameters.

We designed the display small enough for a user to hold it in hand and carry it around, thereby enhancing the haptic experiences in a virtual environment. PoCoPo has 18 motor-driven pins on both sides of a cuboid, providing the sensation of skin contact on the user's palm and fingers. We conducted two user studies to understand the capability of PoCoPo. The first study showed that the participants were generally successful in distinguishing the Shapes rendered by PoCoPo with an average success rate of 88.5%. In the second study, we investigated the acceptable visual size of a virtual object when PoCoPo rendered a physical object of a certain size. The result led to a better understanding of the acceptable differences between the perceptions of visual size and haptic size.","Macro roughness, Shape",Static contact,Partial proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

Thus, it is not surprising that much effort has been devoted to designing haptic systems able to suitably reproduce this information. At the same time, wearability has gained an increasing importance as a novel paradigm to enable a more effective and naturalistic human robot interaction. Capitalizing upon our previous works on grounded softness devices, in this paper we present the Wearable Fabric Yielding Display (W-FYD), a fabric-based tactile display for multi-cue delivery that can be worn by users finger. W-FYD enables to implement both passive and active tactile exploration. Different levels of stiffness can be reproduced by modulating the stretching state of a fabric through two DC motors. An additional vertical degree of freedom is implemented through a lifting mechanism, which enables to convey softness stimuli to the users finger pad. Furthermore, a sliding effect on the finger can be also induced. Experiments with humans show the effectiveness of W-FYD for haptic multi-cue delivery.

To clarify this, we analyzed remote handshaking in which a robot hand that was attached just under a videoconferencing terminal's display moved according to the opening and closing motion of a conversation partner's hand. Combining touch and video channels raises a question as to whether the partner's action of touching a haptic device should be visible to the user. If it can be invisible, the action may be unnecessary, and a unilaterally controlled device may be enough to establish an effective touch channel. Our analysis revealed that the feeling of being close to the partner can be enhanced by mutual touch in which the partner's action needs to occur but should be invisible.",NA,NA,Whole proximate objects,Grounding-off-body,Encountered,Electromagnetic Mechs,Mechanical structures (multiple 1 Dof to a multi-Dof)

We combine a recently invented 6-DOF fingertip device with motion tracking, a head-mounted display, and novel contact-rendering algorithms to enable a user to tactilely explore immersive virtual environments. We evaluate rudimentary 1-DOF, moderate 3-DOF, and complex 6-DOF tactile feedback during Shape discrimination and mass discrimination, also comparing to interactions with real objects. Results from 20 naive study participants show that higher-dimensional tactile feedback may indeed allow completion of a wider range of virtual tasks, but that feedback dimensionality surprisingly does not greatly affect the exploratory techniques employed by the user.","Shape, Mass","Static contact,Pressure",Vibration,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

The visuo-haptic interface is composed of a touch-sensitive visual display based on polymer waveguides and a dielectric elastomer microactuators (DEMA) array. The touch-sensitive visual display, formed via continuative multistep photolithography, is a multilayered structure with a tactile-sensing layer stacked onto a visual-imaging layer. The dual-functional layer is thin (total thickness: <200 mu m) and transparent (transmittance: as high as 90%). The DEMA forming a unit cell of the array is designed as multiple three-dimensional structures with silver nanowires (AgNWs) compliant electrode. When an electric voltage is applied across compliant electrodes formed on the sides, individual microactuators expand directly in an upward direction. Thanks to the vertically deformable design, the DEMA produces programmable large normal forces up to about 30 times of thresholds at a localized area. An output force response of the DEMA is reversible, fast (<1 ms delay), durable (output force degradation: <8% during a million cycles), and large enough to be used in human tactile interfaces. Due to the synergetic benefits from the functional layers, the visuo-haptic interface allows demonstration of programmable tactile response with visual information while being intimately attached on human skin.

Our goal is to convey compelling interactions with virtual objects, such as grasping, squeezing, pressing, lifting, and stroking, without requiring a bulky, world-grounded kinesthetic feedback device (traditional haptics) or the use of predetermined passive objects (haptic retargeting). To achieve this, we use a pair of finger-mounted haptic feedback devices that deform the skin on the fingertips to convey cutaneous force information from object manipulation. We show that users can perceive differences in virtual object weight and that they apply increasing grasp forces when lifting virtual objects as rendered mass is increased. Moreover, we show how naive users perceive changes of a virtual objects physical properties when we use skin deformation to render objects with varying mass, friction, and stiffness. These studies demonstrate that fingertip skin deformation devices can provide a compelling haptic experience appropriate for virtual reality scenarios involving object manipulation.

Rendering of forces by skin deformation in three degrees of freedom (DoF), with contact-no contact capabilities, was implemented through rigid parallel kinematics. The novel asymmetrical three revolute-spherical-revolute (3-RSR) configuration allowed compact dimensions with minimum encumbrance of the hand workspace. The device was designed to render constant to low frequency deformation of the fingerpad in three DoF, combining light weight with relatively high output forces. A differential method for solving the non-trivial inverse kinematics is proposed and implemented in real time for controlling the device. The first experimental activity evaluated discrimination of different fingerpad stretch directions in a group of five subjects. The second experiment, enrolling 19 subjects, evaluated cutaneous feedback provided in a virtual pick-and-place manipulation task. Stiffness of the fingerpad plus device was measured and used to calibrate the physics of the virtual environment. The third experiment with 10 subjects evaluated interaction forces in a virtual lift-and-hold task.

For sensory substitution, participants used 1-DoF and 3-DoF skin deformation feedback to locate a feature in a 3-DoF virtual environment. Participants showed improved precision and shorter completion time when using 3-DoF compared to 1-DoF skin deformation feedback. For sensory augmentation, participants traced a path in space from an initial to a target location, while under guidance from force and/or skin deformation feedback. When force feedback was augmented with skin deformation, participants reduced their path-following error over the cases when force or skin deformation feedback are used separately. We conclude that 3-DoF skin deformation feedback is effective in substituting or augmenting force feedback. Such substitution or augmentation could be used when force feedback is unattainable or attenuated due to device limitations or system instability.",NA,Tool mediated,Force/deformations on the skin,Grounding-off-body,Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,Mechanical structures (multiple 1 Dof to a multi-Dof)

In contrast to traditional vibration feedback, which usually requires that users learn to interpret a binary cue, asymmetric vibrations have been shown to induce a pulling sensation in a desired direction. When attached to the fingers, a single voicecoil actuator presents a translation guidance cue and a pair of voicecoil actuators presents a rotation guidance cue. The directionality of mechanoreceptors in the skin led to our choice of the location and orientation of the actuators in order to elicit very strong sensations in certain directions.

However, current haptic devices, such as Geomagic Touch, fail to provide immersive and natural haptic interaction in virtual surgery due to the inherent mechanical friction, inertia, limited workspace and flawed haptic feedback. To tackle this issue, we design a novel magnetic levitation haptic device based on electromagnetic principles to augment the tissue stiffness perception in virtual environment. Users can naturally interact with the virtual tissue by tracking the motion of magnetic stylus using stereoscopic vision so that they can accurately sense the stiffness by the magnetic stylus, which moves in the magnetic field generated by our device. We propose the idea that the effective magnetic field (EMF) is closely related to the coil attitude for the first time. To fully harness the magnetic field and flexibly generate the specific magnetic field for obtaining required haptic perception, we adopt probability clouds to describe the requirement of interactive applications and put forward an algorithm to calculate the best coil attitude. Moreover, we design a control interface circuit and present a self-adaptive fuzzy proportion integration differentiation (PID) algorithm to precisely control the coil current. We evaluate our haptic device via a series of quantitative experiments which show the high consistency of the experimental and simulated magnetic flux density, the high accuracy (0.28 mm) of real-time 3D positioning and tracking of the magnetic stylus, the low power consumption of the adjustable coil configuration, and the tissue stiffness perception accuracy improvement by 2.38 percent with the self-adaptive fuzzy PID algorithm. We conduct a user study with 22 participants, and the results suggest most of the users can clearly and immersively perceive different tissue stiffness and easily detect the tissue abnormality. Experimental results demonstrate that our magnetic levitation haptic device can provide accurate tissue stiffness perception augmentation with natural and immersive haptic interaction.",Hardness,Tool mediated,Partial proximate objects,Grounding-off-body,Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

A symmetric electromagnet is used in combination with a dipole magnet model and a simple control law to deliver dynamically adjustable forces onto a hand-held tool. The tool only requires an embedded permanent magnet and thus can be entirely untethered. The force, however, while contact-free, remains grounded via the spherical electromagnet and relatively large forces (1N at contact) can be felt by the user. The device is capable of rendering both attracting and repulsive forces in a thin shell around the electromagnet. We report findings from a user experiment with 6 participants, characterizing force delivery aspects and perceived precision of our system. We found that users can discern at least 25 locations for repulsive forces.",NA,Tool mediated,Partial proximate objects,Grounding-off-body,Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

We extend the potential for immersion along these dimensions with the Force Jacket, a novel array of pneumatically-actuated airbags and force sensors that provide precisely directed force and high frequency vibrations to the upper body. We describe the pneumatic hardware and force control algorithms, user studies to verify perception of airbag location and pressure magnitude, and subsequent studies to define full-torso, pressure and vibration-based feel effects such as punch, hug, and snake moving across the body.

The haptic stimuli are generated by controlling pneumatic pressure inside embroidered stretchable tubes. The actuation configuration includes two compression actuators on the proximal and distal forearm, and four uniformly distributed linear actuators around and tangent to the forearm. Further, to ensure a suitable grip force, two soft mutual capacitance sensors are fabricated and integrated into the compression actuators, and a closed-loop force controller is implemented. We physically characterize the static and dynamic behavior of the actuators, as well as the performance of closed-loop control. We quantitatively evaluate the psychophysical characteristics of the six actuators in a set of user studies. Finally, we show the expressiveness of PneuSleeve by evaluating combined haptic stimuli using subjective assessments.",Abstracted,NA,"Vibration, Force/deformations on the skin",Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Existing devices,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

Our design is informed by a series of studies investigating the perceptibility of different sizes, spacings, and attachments of plasters on the forearm. Our matrix arrangement enables the perception of touches, for instance, feeling ones wrist being grabbed or the arm being stroked. Users rated the recreated touch sensations as being fairly similar to a real touch (4.1/5). Even without a visual representation, users were able to correctly distinguish them with an overall accuracy of 94.75%.

To address this gap, we propose HydroRing, an unobtrusive, finger-worn device that can provide the tactile sensations of pressure, vibration, and temperature on the fingertip, enabling mixed-reality haptic interactions. Different from previous explorations, HydroRing in active mode delivers sensations using liquid travelling through a thin, flexible latex tube worn across the fingerpad, and has minimal impact on a user's dexterity and their perception of stimuli in passive mode. Two studies evaluated participants' ability to perceive and recognize sensations generated by the device, as well as their ability to perceive physical stimuli while wearing the device. We conclude by exploring several applications leveraging this mixed-reality haptics approach.",NA,NA,"Vibration, Force/deformations on the skin",Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Existing devices,NA

Many are focused on vibrotactile feedback that requires complicated parameter tuning. Another approach is based on mechanical forces created via piezoelectric devices and other methods for non-vibratory haptic sensations like stretching, twisting. These are often bulky with electronic components and associated drivers are complicated with limited control of timing and precision. This paper proposes HapBead, a new on-skin haptic interface that is capable of rendering vibration like tactile feedback using microfluidics. HapBead leverages a microfluidic channel to precisely and agilely oscillate a small bead via liquid flow, which then generates various motion patterns in channel that creates highly tunable haptic sensations on skin. We developed a proof-of-concept design to implement thin, flexible and easily affordable HapBead platform, and verified its haptic rendering capabilities via attaching it to users' fingertips. A study was carried out and confirmed that participants could accurately tell six different haptic patterns rendered by HapBead. HapBead enables new wearable display applications with multiple integrated functionalities such as on-skin haptic doodles, visuo-haptic displays and haptic illusions.",NA,NA,Vibration,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Existing devices,NA

To inform our design of noticeable air-jet haptic feedback, we conducted a user study to identify absolute detection thresholds. Our results show that the tactile sensation had different sensitivity around the eyes, and we determined a standard intensity (8 mbar) to prevent turbulent airflow blowing into the eyes. In the second study, we asked participants to adjust the intensity around the eye for equal sensation based on standard intensity. Next, we investigated the recognition of point and stroke stimuli with or without inducing cognitive load on eight directions on the eye-ring. Our longStroke stimulus can achieve an accuracy of 82.6% without cognitive load and 80.6% with cognitive load simulated by the Stroop test. Finally, we demonstrate example applications using the skin-stroke display as the off-screen indicator, tactile I/O progress display, and tactile display.",Abstracted,NA,NA,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Existing devices,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

Previous researchers have highlighted the feasibility of haptic technology in smart-rings and their promise in delivering noticeable stimulations by poking a limited set of planar locations on the finger. However, the full potential of poking as a mechanism to deliver richer and more expressive information on the finger is overlooked. With three studies and a total of 76 participants, we informed the design of PokeRing, a smart-ring capable of delivering information via stimulating eight different locations around the index finger's proximal phalanx. We report our evaluation of the performance of PokeRing in semi-realistic wearable conditions, (standing and walking), and its effective usage for information transfer with twenty-one spatio-temporal patterns designed by six interaction designers in a workshop. Finally, we present three applications that exploit PokeRing's notification usages.",Abstracted,NA,Force/deformations on the skin,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Electromagnetic Mechs,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

MagTics' thin form factor and flexibility allows for rich haptic feedback in mobile settings. We propose a novel actuation mechanism based on bistable electromagnetic latching that combines high frame rate and holding force with low energy consumption and a soft and flexible form factor. We overcome limitations of traditional soft actuators by placing several hard actuation cells, driven by flexible printed electronics, in a soft 3D printed case. A novel EM-shielding prevents magnet-magnet interactions and allows for high actuator densities. A prototypical implementation comprising of 4 actuated pins on a 1.7 cm pitch, with 2 mm travel, and generating 160 mN to 200 mN of latching force is used to implement a number of compelling application scenarios including adding haptic and tactile display capabilities to wearable devices, to existing input devices and to provide localized haptic feedback in virtual reality.

Humans perceive multiple haptic features of an object such as its stiffness, temperature, and Shape, and rely on this multimodal information to achieve dexterous manipulation. However, to date, remote manipulators rarely provide haptic information to the operator. Moreover, current multimodal displays are often too rigid and bulky to be integrated into the manipulator. Thus, to improve the quality of teleoperation, there is a high demand for flexible devices that are capable of matching the skins Macro roughness while delivering multimodal haptic information to the operator. In this paper, we present a flexible tactile display delivering tactile and thermal stimuli to the users skin. We propose a hybrid electromagnetic-pneumatic actuation to operate a 2 x 2 array of tactile cells. Each cell provides a repetitive stimulation with a force and an indentation that are above the human perception threshold for the finger, palm, and forearm. In addition, the temperature of the displays surface is controlled using a Peltier element attached to an air-cooled heatsink. By providing a reproducible cooling gradient, our display simulates common materials encountered in the daily environment. User study results show that (1) the tactile stimulation is perceived well and (2) the identification rates of objects simulated with the display were comparable to those obtained with real objects. Unlike previous devices, the thermal stimulation is delivered while the display is in constant contact with the users skin, a necessary requirement for teleoperation. These results demonstrate the potential of our device as a promising tactile display for providing haptic feedback in teleoperation.

The device adopts an indirect actuation method by using a rigid coupling, which aims to avoid direct contact of the human skin with the actuator. The rigid coupling is made of silicone to transmit the movement of the actuator to the touch layer located on the top surface of the coupling and provides the feeling of softness on contact. The device produces displacement about 350-140 mu m at 0.3-10 Hz, which meets frequency requirements for simulating the Merkel cells as well as Meissner corpuscle.

To allow for high-voltage operation, the HVTFT implements a zinc-tin oxide channel, a thick dielectric stack, and an offset gate. At a source-drain bias of 1 kV, the HVTFT has a 20 mu A on-current at a gate voltage bias of 30 V. Their electrical characteristics enable the switching of DEAs which require drive voltages of over 1 kV, making control of an array simpler in comparison to the use of external high-voltage switching. These HVTFTs are integrated in a flexible haptic display consisting of a 4 x 4 matrix of DEAs and HVTFTs. Using a single 1.4 kV supply, each DEA is independently switched by its associated HVTFT, requiring only a 30 V gate voltage for full DEA deflection. The 4 x 4 display operates well even when bent to a 5 mm radius of Macro roughness. By enabling DEA switching at low voltages, flexible metal-oxide HVTFTs enable complex flexible systems with dozens to hundreds of independent DEAs for applications in haptics, Braille displays, and soft robotics.

For this reason, utilizing the characteristics that the rheological properties of magnetorheological (MR) fluid can be continuously and reversibly changed by an external magnetic field within a few milliseconds, a multidirectional controlled three-DOF spherical MR actuator is proposed in this paper. Through the special design of the stator part, the actuator can implement force feedback control in multiple directions. Then, based on the calculated torque model and analysis of the magnetic circuit, finite-element analysis is used to optimize the geometry and internal magnetic field distribution of the actuator. In order to achieve precise control and positioning of multi-DOF motion, a small inertial measurement unit is integrated in the upper part of the joystick. We built a prototype of this actuator and tested its performance under various control conditions. The results show that the actuator can provide force feedback with reasonable magnitude and direction to users according to the change of interaction conditions, thus overcoming the disadvantage of the existing spherical MR actuators that limit the movement of the user in all directions after being activated.",NA,NA,Partial proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Encountered,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

In each structure, not only the form factor but also the force feedback properties can be tuned through geometric parameters. We experimentally analyzed and modeled the structures, and implemented software to automatically generate 2D patterns for desired haptic properties.

To demonstrate realistic pseudo tactile sensation for the users, a tactile display is needed that can provide multiple tactile stimuli. In this paper, we have explicated a novel printed tactile display that can provide both the electrical stimulus and the electrostatic force. The circuit patterns for each stimulus were fabricated by employing the technique of double-sided conductive ink printing. Requirements for the fabrication process were analyzed and the durability of the tactile display was evaluated. Users' perceptions of a single tactile stimulus and multiple tactile stimuli were also investigated. The obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed tactile display is capable of exhibiting realistic tactile sensation and can be incorporated by various applications such as tactile sensation printing of pictorial illustrations and paintings. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid tactile display can contribute to accelerated prototyping and development of new tactile devices.

Magnetic force has not been efficiently explored in haptic design because it is not intuitive and there is a lack of methods to associate or visualize magnetic force with haptic sensations, especially for complex magnetic patterns. To represent the haptic sensations of magnetic force intuitively, magneto-haptics formularizes haptic potential from the distribution of magnetic force along the path of motion. It provides a rapid way to compute the relationship between the magnetic phenomena and the haptic mechanism. Thus, we can convert a magnetic force distribution into a haptic sensation model, making the design of magnet-embedded haptic sensations more efficient. We demonstrate three applications of magneto-haptics through interactive interfaces and devices. We further verify our theory by evaluating some magneto-haptic designs through experiments.",Mechanical Mechs,NA,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Encountered,Magnetic force,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

In the method, named ""Magnetic Plotter"", a desktop digital plotting machine combined with a tiny neodymium magnet writes fine magnetic patterns on the surface of the magnetic rubber sheets. This method enables users to design magnetic fields freely with inexpensive commercially available materials as if they are drawing pictures. Moreover, when the magnetic sheets are rubbed together, unique haptic stimuli are displayed on the fingers. The haptic stimuli can be changed by the magnetic patterns designed on the rubber sheets. We developed a prototype of the Magnetic Plotter and investigated the range of the generated haptic stimuli and the texture design possibilities.

However, it is difficult to arrange fine and complex magnetic fields rapidly. Therefore, we invented a method for fabricating complex geometric magnetic patterns by overlaying multiple magnetic rubber sheets. This method resolves the tradeoff between magnetized pattern complexity and the time required for magnetization. By layering multiple magnetic sheets that have simple magnetic patterns, various types of geometric magnetic patterns, such as checkered and diamond ones, can be generated on the top surface. By applying superposed magnetic fields, various types of tactile stimuli and haptic interaction can be created rapidly. Furthermore, the superposed magnetic fields can be changed dynamically by rotating the layered magnetic sheets. In this paper, we clarify the material requirements and describe the design method for creating these geometric magnetic patterns. We also demonstrate several of their applications.",Mechanical Mechs,NA,Whole proximate objects,"Ungrounding (handheld,portable) (handheld,portable)",Encountered,Magnetic force,Spatial distribution of simple actuators

Due to this simplicity, Chasm can render low-frequency skin-stretch and high-frequency vibrations, simultaneously and independently. We present the design of the actuator assembly and validate its electromechanical and perceptual performance. We then explore use cases and show design solutions for embedding Chasm in device prototypes. Finally, we report investigations with Chasm in two VR embodiments, i.e., in a headgear band to induce locomotion cues and in a handheld pointer to enhance dynamic manual interactions. Our explorations show wide use for Chasm in enhancing user interactions and experience in virtual and augmented settings.

The MMAP transmissively reflects the rays from an object, and a pair of them reconstructs the floating aerial image of the object. Our system can optically copy adjacent environments based on this technology. Haptic feedback is also given by using an airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD). Converged ultrasound can give force feedback in midair. Based on the optical characteristics of the MMAPs, the cloned image and the user share an identical coordinate system.

In this paper, we present the design, development, and evaluation of Haptogram; a system designed to provide point-cloud tactile display via acoustic radiation pressure. A tiled 2-D array of ultrasound transducers is used to produce a focal point that is animated to produce arbitrary 2-D and 3-D tactile Shapes. The switching speed is very high, so that humans feel the distributed points simultaneously. The Haptogram system comprises a software component and a hardware component. The software component enables users to author and/or select a tactile object, create a point-cloud representation, and generate a sequence of focal points to drive the hardware. The hardware component comprises a tiled 2-D array of ultrasound transducers, each driven by an FPGA. A quantitative analysis is conducted to measure the Haptogram ability to display various tactile Shapes, including a single point, 2-D Shapes (a straight line and a circle) and a 3-D object (a hemisphere). Results show that all displayed tactile objects are perceivable by the human skin (an average of 2.65 kPa for 200 focal points). A usability study is also conducted to evaluate the ability of humans to recognize 2-D Shapes. Results show that the recognition rate was well above the chance level (average of 59.44% and standard deviation of 12.75%) while the recognition time averaged 13.87 s (standard deviation of 3.92 s).

More recently, the illusion has also been elicited on non-contiguous parts of the body, such as between one hand and the other, either when the hands are interconnected or not interconnected by an object (e.g., when holding a tablet or not). Here, we explore the reproducibility of the intermanual tactile illusion of movement between two free hands by employing mid-air tactile stimulation. We investigate the optimal parameters to generate a continuous and smooth motion using two arrays of ultrasound speakers and two stimulation techniques (i.e., static versus dynamic focal point). In the first experiment, we investigate the occurrence of the illusion when using a static focal point, and we define a perceptive model. In the second experiment, we examine the illusion using a dynamic focal point, defining a second perceptive model.

We consider two-layers of regions in the space that forms a virtual button. A user's hand is tracked by a sensor and stimulated by the two methods according to the hand position. When the user's hand is in the upper or lower layer, the hand skin is stimulated weakly or strongly by the two methods, respectively. These two states indicate a neutral position and action completion. This midair click was enabled by a recent finding where an ultrasound focus motion on the skin produced a stronger perception than amplitude modulation given at a constant position. We conducted experiments to confirm whether two haptic layers can be perceived. In addition, we investigated whether a blind operation of button selection can be performed.",Mechanical Mechs,Pressure,Vibration,Grounding-off-body,Encountered,Existing devices,NA

Ultrasound phased arrays stimulate skin in mid air by controlling pressure waves at particular spatial locations. In this work, we explore the connection between the pressure-based stimulation of ultrasound haptics and the actual pressure field experienced when interacting with fluid media, to devise a novel algorithm for ultrasound-based rendering of tactile interaction with fluids. Our algorithm extracts the target pressure field on a virtual hand from an interactive fluid simulation, and formulates the computation of the rendered pressure as an optimization problem. We have designed an efficient solver for this optimization problem, and we show results of interactive experiments with several fluid simulations.",NA,NA,Partial proximate objects,Grounding-off-body,Encountered,Existing devices,NA

Leveraging those features, a new modulation technique producing spatially distributed tactile sensations has recently been introduced. This new approach, referred to as Spatiotemporal Modulation (STM), draws lines, curves and Shapes on users' palm by moving a mid-air tactile point rapidly and repeatedly along the path. STM parameters and their impact on tactile perception are yet to be studied systematically. In this work, we first study how varying the draw frequency and the size of a simple Shape affects the participants perception of texture and their emotional responses. In the second part of our study, we used the most salient tactile patterns of the first study to extend the results within a multimodal context. We found that tactile patterns' perception was consistent within both studies. We also found instances when the tactile patterns could alter the perception of the audio and visual stimuli. Finally, we discuss the benefits of our findings and conclude with implications for future work.",Abstracted,NA,Partial proximate objects,Grounding-off-body,Encountered,Existing devices,NA

The key idea that allows the small and light impacto device to simulate a strong hit is that it decomposes the stimulus: it renders the tactile aspect of being hit by tapping the skin using a solenoid; it adds impulse to the hit by thrusting the user's arm backwards using electrical muscle stimulation. The device is self-contained, wireless, and small enough for wearable use, and thus leaves the user unencumbered and able to walk around freely in a virtual environment. The device is of generic Shape, allowing it to also be worn on legs so as to enhance the experience of kicking, or merged into props, such as a baseball bat. We demonstrate how to assemble multiple impacto units into a simple haptic suit. Participants of our study rated impacts simulated using impacto's combination of a solenoid hit and electrical muscle stimulation as more realistic than either technique in isolation.

This rotation and extension, generally felt via the users fingers, is used to represent heading and proximity to navigational targets. The device is intended to provide an alternative to screen or audio based interfaces for visually impaired, hearing impaired, deafblind, and sighted pedestrians. The motivation and design of the haptic device is presented, followed by the results of a navigation experiment that aimed to determine the role of each device DOF, in terms of facilitating guidance. An additional device, `The Haptic Taco, which modulated its volume in response to target proximity (negating directional feedback), was also compared. Results indicate that while the heading (rotational) DOF benefited motion efficiency, the proximity (translational) DOF benefited velocity. Combination of the two DOF improved overall performance.

Most of the current technologies work to simulate changes in tactile perception (via electrostatic, lateral force fields, vibration motors, etc.) without creating actual topographical transformations. This makes it challenging to provide localized feedback. Here, a new concept for on-demand surface texture augmentation that is capable of physically forming local topographic features in any predesigned pattern is demonstrated. The transparent, flexible, integrable device comprises of a hybrid electrode system with conductive hydrogel, silver nanowires, and conductive polymers with acrylic elastomer as the dielectric layer. Desired surface textures can be controlled by a predesigned pattern of electrodes, which operates as independent or interconnected actuators. Surface features with up to a height of 0.155 mm can be achieved with a transformation time of less than a second for a device area of 18 cm(2). High transparency levels of 76% are achieved due to the judicious choice of the electrode and the active elastomer layer. The capability of localized and controlled deformations makes this system highly useful for applications such as display touchscreens, touchpads, braille displays, on-demand buttons, and microfluidic devices.

This haptic actuator consists of an upper layer, a lower layer, and fabric made by twisting long and slender PVC gel strings. The PVC gel fabric changes its Shape according to the input voltage waveform, and exerts an electrostatic force between the upper and lower layers. When the applied voltage is removed, the PVC gel fabric rapidly restores to its initial configuration. Consequently, these effects generate vibrations that are sufficiently strong for human perception. In this paper, we conducted quantitative experiments to investigate the performance of our soft haptic actuator using an accelerometer and a laser scanning vibrometer. Furthermore, we performed a perceptual evaluation and the results indicate that our proposed actuator can stimulate the human skin with sufficient perceptual strength.

To make an active tactile surface, the transparent haptic interface employs a silver nanowire (AgNW) electrode to be compliant with the deformed elastomer surface. Here, the dielectric elastomer is newly blended with polydimethylsiloxane and Ecoflex pre-polymer to simultaneously control the mechanical stiffness and transparency. The relative resistance of the AgNW electrode on a single void line is nearly unchanged under bending test, confirming the high stretchability and conductivity of the nanowire-networked electrode. The optical transparencies are 92-85%, depending on the ratio of the Ecoflex solution. Transparency values decreas by 7 and 16% after coating with AgNWs at densities of 30 and 140 mg m(-2), respectively. Using EP31, the void line is deformed by 90 mu m under a field intensity of 13.0 V mu m(-1). The haptic surface is successfully controlled by applying voltage, which produces four different surface textures, from relatively smooth to rough feeling, depending on the distance between deformed void lines. This haptic interface can be applied to diverse display systems as an external add-on screen and will help to realize programmable surface textures in the future.

We briefly describe the architecture of the actuators and their mechanical and electrical integration into a wearable armband. We then characterize the actuators force, displacement, and thermal properties in a bench-top configuration. We also report on the power and drive circuit design. Finally, we perform a set of preliminary perception evaluations on participants using our haptic device, including detection threshold tests and identification tests for locations and directions on the forearm. Human testing with individual actuators demonstrates that the broadband actuation can be easily perceived on the forearm, providing the basis for both the development of a wearable actuator array and its use in more extensive perception evaluation as described herein.

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a novel electroionic antagonistic muscle based on HPNC electrodes successfully displays extremely reliable and large bending deformations and long-term durability under ultralow input voltages.

Kinesthesia—the sense of motion—is triggered by imposing forces upon the joints, tendons, and muscles to recreate the geometry and stiffness of objects, as may be useful in physical therapy or virtual reality. Here, we introduce a form of kinesthetic feedback by manipulating the mechanical properties of spandex impregnated with a thermoplastic polymer. Heating or cooling this textile-thermoplastic composite just above or below its glass transition temperature (Tg) dramatically changes its mechanical properties (corresponding to a decrease in storage modulus from 36 MPa to 0.55 MPa). In the form of a glove, the composite can also be healed after inadvertent overextension in its stiffened state by heating it above its Tg. When fitted with thermoelectric devices for active heating and cooling, the flexible or stiffened state of a glove can be perceived by human subjects. As an example of a human-machine interface, the glove is used to control a robotic finger. When the robotic finger makes contact with a wall, a signal is sent to thermoelectric devices in the glove to cool (stiffen the finger) and thus provide kinesthetic feedback to the user.",NA,NA,Force/movements across joints,Grounding-on-multiple-body-parts,Worn,Phase transformation materials,NA

The intrinsic multistable nature of SMPs, and their more than 100-fold variation in stiffness over a narrow temperature range, enables dense arrays of actuators exhibiting simultaneously large strokes and high holding forces. The control challenge of addressing a very large number of soft actuators is solved by patterning an array of miniature stretchable heaters on a thin SMP membrane, so that one single pneumatic supply is sufficient to rapidly and selectively reconfigure any or all elements. The device consists of a 40 mu m thick SMP layer, on which 32 x 24 stretchable heaters are integrated, interconnected by a flexible printed circuit board, and bonded to a stretchable 3D-printed pneumatic chamber. Each taxel can be individually controlled via row/column addressing, and requires 2.5 s to latch to a different state. The active skin weighs only 55 g and is 2 mm thick. More than 99% of the 768 taxels are fully functional, with a lifetime in excess of 20 000 cycles. This architecture enables applications in haptic displays, active camouflage, biomimetic robots, microfluidics, and new human machine interfaces.

For practical use and wider application of the device, it is developed with the aim of achieving high wearability and mobility/portability as well as cutaneous force feedback functionality. A main body of the device is designed as a ring-Shaped lightweight structure with a simple driving mechanism, and thin Shape memory alloy (SMA) wires having high energy density are applied as actuating elements. Also, based on a band-type wireless control unit including a wireless data communication module, the whole device could be realized as a wearable mobile haptic device system. These features enable the device to take diverse advantages on functional performances and to provide users with significant usability. In this work, the proposed miniature haptic ring is systematically designed, and its working performances are experimentally evaluated with a fabricated functional prototype. The experimental results obviously demonstrate that the proposed device exhibits higher force-toweight ratio than conventional finger-wearable haptic devices for cutaneous force feedback. Also, it is investigated that operational performances of the device are strongly influenced by electro-thermomechanical behaviors of the SMA actuator. In addition to the experiments for performance evaluation, we conduct a preliminary user test to assess practical feasibility and usability based on users qualitative feedback.",NA,NA,Force/deformations on the skin,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Shape memory materials,NA

It is also capable of working with DC excitation, an aspect which stands out against previous reports which utilize purely AC excitation. This work also proposes a unified force model for this effect, drawn from electrostatic chuck research, and resolves this model with those in previous reports. We briefly discuss the background and specifics of the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, and include measurements made with our own electroadhesive surface and experimental apparatus.

We propose using lateral force feedback to enhance these experiences. When virtual objects on the smartwatch display visually collide or push the edge of the screen, we add haptic feedback so that the user also feels the impact. This addition creates the illusion of a virtual object that is physically hitting or pushing the smartwatch, from within the device itself. Using this approach, we extend virtual space and scenes into a 2D physical space. To create realistic lateral force feedback, we first examined the minimum change in force magnitude that is detectable by users in different directions and weight levels, finding an average JND of 49% across all tested conditions, with no significant effect of weight and force direction. We then developed a proof-of-concept hardware prototype called Jetto and demonstrated its unique capabilities through a set of impact-enhanced videos and games. Our preliminary user evaluations indicated the concept was welcomed and is regarded as a worthwhile addition to smartwatch output and media experiences.",Abstracted,NA,Force/deformations on the skin,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Existing devices,NA

Parallel or serial chains of compliant flexure mechanisms, driven by piezoelectric actuators (PEAS) are ideal microposidoners for these tasks. They offer smooth, continuous motion with subnanometric accuracy. However, cross-coupling and assembly errors limit their tracking precision when multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are used, and current manufacturing techniques limit mechanisms to planar designs. This paper presents a methodology which enables a human operator to precisely control the motion of a multi-DOF piezo-actuated flexure mechanism with haptic feedback. An experimental master-slave manipulator is investigated, consisting of a 4-DOF hybrid parallel-serial slave mechanism. Internal sensors and kinematic information enable the estimation of slave position and orientation. From this, a bilateral haptic controller has been developed to compensate for coupling and assembly errors, and PEA hysteresis nonlinearities present in the slave mechanism. Master mechanism inverse dynamics control is implemented to offset master mechanism inertia, whilst passivity control guarantees stability. Experimental analysis demonstrates precisions of approximately 30 nm can be achieved during low speed interactions, with intuitive environmental force feedback. With appropriate choice of end-effector, the system could be used for tasks such as the assembly of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

These small-scale clutches were designed in our lab, and their evaluation were reported previously [1], [2]. MRF-based actuators exhibit superior characteristics, which can significantly contribute to transparency and stability of haptic devices. Based on these actuators, a distributed antagonistic configuration is used to develop the 2-DoF haptic interface. This device is incorporated in a master-slave teleoperation setup intended for medical percutaneous interventions and soft-tissue palpation. Preliminary studies on the stability and transparency of the haptic interface in this setup using phantom and ex vivo samples show the great potential of MRF-based actuators for integration in haptic devices that require reliable, safe, accurate, highly transparent, and stable force reflection.

These interfaces have been evaluated in a number of medical and surgical simulators where they can provide cues regarding the viscoelastic properties of tissues. The present experiment determined whether eight different Shapes could be identified reliably with a MRF haptic display and compared the information transfer (IT) associated with this type of display with that achieved by other forms of haptic communication. The overall performance of participants at identifying the Shapes was good with a mean score of 70% correct and an IT of 2.13 bits.

abstract = {We present TableHop, a tabletop display that provides controlled self-actuated deformation and vibro-tactile feedback to an elastic fabric surface while retaining the ability for high-resolution visual projection. The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based Shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the Shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors.

The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based Shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the Shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors.

We observed that position-controlled cursors paired well with relative bend feedback, while rate-controlled cursors paired well with absolute bend feedback to indicate targets. We also explored an eyes-free condition. Results suggest that while eyes-free, haptic feedback conditions were more error-prone than visual-only conditions, the size of the error was relatively small, and users were able to complete the task in all cases.

For vivid and immersive interaction, a combination of both tactile and kinesthetic information must be presented to users. While vibrotactile feedback has become ubiquitous in todays handheld devices, traditional kinesthetic actuators present significant challenges to miniaturization. Moreover, only limited success has been achieved in developing haptic actuators capable of conveying both tactile and kinesthetic sensations for small consumer electronics. Therefore, this study presents a compact actuator based on electrorheological (ER) fluid for generating a wide range of concurrent kinesthetic and tactile feedback. The design focus for the proposed actuator is to activate multiple operating modes of ER fluid to maximize the force generated by the actuator within a given small size constraint. To this end, the design incorporated two ground electrodes (a stationary ring electrode and a movable electrode attached to a spring element) for tuning the fluids yield stress in both flow and squeeze modes. After fabricating a prototype actuator, testing was performed with a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and an accelerometer to evaluate its ability to produce a wide range of kinesthetic feedback, as well as distinct vibrotactile feedback up to the limit of human perception. The results of kinesthetic testing indicate that the actuator can generate large forces (6.2 N maximum at 4 kV) at rates greater than the just-noticeable difference, indicating that the actuator can convey a wide range of kinesthetic sensations. Tactile evaluation using DMA and the processed acceleration response demonstrated that the actuator can generate both low and high frequency (up to 300 Hz) vibrotactile sensations at perceivably high intensity.",NA,NA,Force/deformations on the skin,NA,NA,Rheological materials,NA

We present GyroTab, a relatively flat handheld system that utilizes the gyro effect to provide torque feedback. GyroTab relies on the user to produce an input torque and provides feedback by opposing that torque, making its feedback reactive to the user's motion.

We demonstrate two such controllers, NormalTouch and TextureTouch. Both controllers are tracked with 6 DOF and produce spatially-registered haptic feedback to a users finger. NormalTouch haptically renders object surfaces and provides force feedback using a tiltable and extrudable platform. TextureTouch renders the Shape of virtual objects including detailed surface structure through a 4x4 matrix of actuated pins. By moving our controllers around in space while keeping their finger on the actuated platform, users obtain the impression of a much larger 3D Shape by cognitively integrating output sensations over time. Our evaluation compares the effectiveness of our controllers with the two defacto standards in Virtual Reality controllers: device vibration and visual feedback only. We find that haptic feedback significantly increases the accuracy of VR interaction, most effectively by rendering high-fidelity Shape output as in the case of our controllers. Participants also generally found NormalTouch and TextureTouch realistic in conveying the sense of touch for a variety of 3D objects.

However, controlled and rigorous HCI research is needed to understand the basic characteristics of perception of this new feedback medium, and so how best to utilise ultrasonic haptics in an interface. This paper describes two experiments conducted into two fundamental aspects of ultrasonic haptic perception: 1) localisation of a static point and 2) the perception of motion. Understanding these would provide insight into 1) the spatial resolution of an ultrasonic interface and 2) what forms of feedback give the most convincing illusion of movement. Results show an average localisation error of 8.5mm, with higher error along the longitudinal axis. Convincing sensations of motion were produced when travelling longer distances, using longer stimulus durations and stimulating multiple points along the trajectory.

It could for example be used to train and simulate medical palpation. During palpation, users tap, indent, and rub the surface of a sample to estimate the underlying properties. However, up to now there is no good approach to render such intricate interaction realistically. This paper introduces 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) encountered-type haptic display technology for simulating surface exploration tasks. Among the different phases of exploration, this article focuses on the `in-contact sliding' phase. Two novel control approaches to render sliding over a virtual surface are elaborated. A first rendering method generates lateral frictional forces as the finger slides over the surface. A second method adjusts the inclination of the end-effector to render tissue properties. With both methods a stiff nodule embedded in a soft tissue was prepared. User experiments were carried out to find proper parameter and intensity ranges and to confirm the feasibility of the new rendering schemes. Participants indicated that both rendering schemes felt realistic. Compared to earlier work, where only the vertical stiffness was altered, lower thresholds to detect and localise embedded virtual nodules were found. Users also made fewer errors in detecting nodule edges. Furthermore, the method that used end-effector inclination allowed faster discovery of the nodule's edges. It is expected that approaches that combine both rendering methods could provide an even more realistic feel.","Hardness,Macro roughness",Lateral motion,"Force/deformations on the skin, Force/movements across joints",Grounding-off-body,Grasped,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

proposes haptics as an alternative means to provide neurofeedback and investigates
its effectiveness by conducting two user studies (Study- I & II ) using a novel
compact wearable haptic device that provides vibrotactile feedback to the user’s
neck. Each user study has three neurofeedback modes: visual-only, haptics-only,
and visual-and-haptics combined. Study- I examines the participant’s performance
in a brain-training task by measuring their attention level (AL) and the task
completion time (CT). Study- II , in addition to the brain-training task, investigates
the participants’ ability to perform a secondary task (playing a Shape-sorting game)
while receiving the neurofeedback. Results show that users performed similarly well
in brain-training with haptics-only and visual-only feedback. However, when
engaged in a secondary task, the users performed significantly better (AL and CT
improved around 11% and 17%, respectively) with haptics, indicating a clear
advantage of haptics over visual neurofeedback. Being able to perform routine
activities during brain-training would likely increase user adherence to longer
therapy sessions. In the future, we plan to verify these findings by conducting

activities, but there are few technologies for computationally
augmenting free-hand interactions with real environments. Here,
we describe Tactile Echoes, a finger-wearable system for
augmenting touch interactions with physical objects. This system
captures and processes touch-elicited vibrations in real-time in
order to enliven tactile experiences. In this article, we process these
signals via a parametric signal processing network in order to
generate responsive tactile and auditory feedback. Just as acoustic
echoes are produced through the delayed replication and
modification of sounds, so are Tactile Echoes produced through
transformations of vibrotactile inputs in the skin. The echoes also
reflect the contact interactions and touched objects involved. A
transient tap produces discrete echoes, while a continuous slide
yields sustained feedback. We also demonstrate computational and
spatial tracking methods that allow these effects to be selectively
assigned to different objects or actions. A large variety of distinct
multisensory effects can be designed via ten processing parameters.
We investigated how Tactile Echoes are perceived in several
perceptual experiments using multidimensional scaling methods.
This allowed us to deduce low-dimensional, semantically grounded
perceptual descriptions. We present several virtual and augmented
reality applications of Tactile Echoes. In a user study, we found that
these effects made interactions more responsive and engaging. Our
findings show how to endow a large variety of touch interactions
with expressive multisensory effects.",Abstracted,NA,Vibration,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,Electromagnetic Mechs,NA

One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching).

Route guidance systems enable users to efficiently navigate between locations using dynamic visual maps and audio directions, and have been well tested with motorists, but remain unsafe for use by motorcyclists. Audio/visual routing systems decrease motorcyclists' situational awareness and vehicle control, and thus elevate chances of an accident.

Upon absorbing these stimulants, which contain safe and small doses of key active ingredients, receptors in the user's skin are NAly triggered, rendering distinct haptic sensations. We identified five NAs that can render lasting haptic sensations: tingling (sanshool), numbing (lidocaine), stinging (cinnamaldehyde), warming (capsaicin), and cooling (menthol). To enable the application of our novel approach in a variety of settings (such as VR), we engineered a self-contained wearable that can be worn anywhere on the user's skin (e.g., face, arms, legs). Implemented as a soft silicone patch, our device uses micropumps to push the liquid stimulants through channels that are open to the user's skin, enabling topical stimulants to be absorbed by the skin as they pass through. Our approach presents two unique benefits. First, it enables sensations, such as numbing, not possible with existing haptic devices. Second, our approach offers a new pathway, via the skin's NA receptors, for achieving multiple haptic sensations using a single actuator, which would otherwise require combining multiple actuators (e.g., Peltier, vibration motors, electro-tactile stimulation). We evaluated our approach by means of two studies. In our first study, we characterized the temporal profiles of sensations elicited by each NA. Using these insights, we designed five interactive VR experiences utilizing NA haptics, and in our second user study, participants rated these VR experiences with NA haptics as more immersive than without. Finally, as the first work exploring the use of NA haptics on the skin, we offer recommendations to designers for how they may employ our approach for their interactive experiences.",Haptic effects,NA,NA,Grounding-on-one-body-part,Worn,NA,NA
