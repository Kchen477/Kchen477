,,H1,Haptic Sensations
,,text,"Supported haptic sensations include sensations to simulate object properties, action effects, and abstracted sensations"
,,H2,Object properties
,,text,"Whereas prior categorizations of objects’ haptic properties include surface, structure, mass properties, and *thermal qualities, the present categorization adds mechanical mechanismsy referring to the constrained motion of the parts of an object, and force/motion reflecting external mechanical effects on objects. "
,,H3,Surface
,,text,"Surface properties vary along five main factors: macro and fine roughness, warmness (cold-warm), hardness (hard-soft), and friction (moistness-dryness, stickiness-slipperiness), as characterized by Okamoto et al. \cite{okamoto2012psychophysical}, and perceived softness covaries with the material viscoelasticity, granularity, and furriness \cite{cavdan2019many,dovencioǧlu2022hand }"

,,H2,Haptic effects
,,text,"Haptic effects are haptic sensations from interactions with objects ( from interactions ) or actions without objects ( from actions ), but are insufficient for users to perceive the object properties (material, structure)."
D13,from interactions,note,"Examples of haptic effects from interactions include hitting and being hit rendered by Impacto \cite{lopes2015impacto}, the sensations of punch, hug, and snake moving across the body provided by Force Jacket \cite{delazio2018force}, and feeling one's wrist being grabbed or the arm being stroked enabled by Touch Me Gently \cite{muthukumarana2020touch}."
D14,from actions,note,"Haptic sensations from actions are simulated by a few devices. For example, GyroVR \cite{gugenheimer2016gyrovr}, head-worn flywheels, render kinesthetic forces generate from motions, such as flying, diving, or floating in outer space, onto users’ body, and device proposed by Sra el al. \cite{sra2019adding} adds proprioceptive feedback to virtual motion such as driving, navigating by flying, teleporting, or riding."
,,H2,Abstracted
,,text,Abstracted haptic sensations are not related to physical objects or actions.
D15,simple feedback,note,"Simple feedback refers to simple haptic effects that are presented in response to successful gestures, proved to improve the sense of control \cite{carter2013ultrahaptics}."
D16,simple notifications,note,"Simple notifications refer to simple haptic effects initiated by systems to signal notifications. For instance, simple notifications can take the forms of vibrations and skin strokes and be delivered around fingers \cite{je2018pokering}, eyes \cite{tseng2020skin},  and wrists \cite{pece2017magtics}."
D17,dgrees,note,"Degrees refer to haptic expressions of levels of specific measures. For example, UltraHaptics modulates the wave pressure of ultrasound above a map to project population density \cite{carter2013ultrahaptics}."
D18,spatical sensations,note,"Spatial sensations refer to simple haptic effects presented at specific locations on a device \cite{ pielot2012pocketnavigator, yatani2012spacesense} or user body part \cite{prasad2014haptimoto}, are commonly for navigation use."
D19,directional sensations,note,"Directional sensations can be encoded into directional vibration patterns \cite{pielot2012pocketnavigator}, asymmetric vibrations \cite{culbertson2017waves, rekimoto2014traxion}, and forces \cite{yamaoka2013depend}, and guide a user to move toward a particular position."
D20,encoded information,note,"Encoded information refers to haptic sensations that express relatively complex information, such as braille, that require users to learn and remember the projections between the haptic sensations and information."

,,H1,User Manipulations
,,text,"The above illustrations and descriptions might seem to focus on hands, as they constitute the most dexterous and sensitive motor-sensory system. However, user manipulation values are independent of body parts or activities. For example, Strohmeier et al. present bAReFoot, a prototype shoe rendering material experience in walking \cite{strohmeier2020barefoot}. The authors decompose walking into isotonic and isometric parts, identical to lateral motion and pressure performed by feet respectively.}"

,,H1,Haptic Stimuli
,,text,"Haptic stimuli refer to physical changes that are generated by haptic interfaces and perceived by users to form haptic sensations. Knowing haptic stimuli causing specific percepts and machine mechanisms that generate the stimuli is essential to designing interfaces to simulate haptic sensations. This forms a prerequisite understanding for designing haptic interfaces, and in other words, the haptic stimuli dimension bridges the human haptics and machine haptics side of any haptic interface."
,,text,"If categorizing the interfaces through the lens of haptic perception processes (Figure \ref{fig:haptic stimuli}), whereas prior reviews \cite{biswas2019emerging, pacchierotti2017wearable, basdogan2020review} often confine haptic stimuli to on-body changes that happen when users’ body is contacting an object, we include prior-contact and post-contact stimuli. Prior-contact stimuli are proximate objects with haptic properties identical to virtual counterparts. Post-contact stimuli refer to in-body changes triggered by the on-body changes. The on-body changes trigger mechanoreceptors embedded in haptic organs to emit electrochemical signals traveling through nerve systems to the central cortex, finally forming a percept. Post-contact stimuli address haptic simulation with electrical signals on the mechanoreceptors, nerves, and brain. In summary, the haptic stimuli dimension has the following first-level values:"
,,enumerate,"Proximate objects, which refer to objects with haptic properties similar to virtual counterparts."
,,enumerate,"On-body effects, which refers to mechanical and *thermal effects that resemble what would happen to a human body during natural interactions."
,,enumerate,"Electrical and *chemical signals, which refer to electrical signals that resemble those generated by a body during natural touches."
,,text,"Here, we explain the stimulus categories with an example of simulating the haptic sensations of pressing a button:"
,,enumerate,"To provide a proximate object. Researchers have presented many mechanisms mimicking the haptic properties of physical buttons using, e.g., motorized mechanisms \cite{kim2016hapthimble}, pneumatic \cite{vazquez20153d}, kirigami structures\cite{chang2020kirigami}, membrane domes \cite{klamka2018pushables}, magnetic materials \cite{zheng2019mechamagnets,ogata2015fluxpaper, yasu2019magnetact, ogata2018magneto}, and methods to position the physical equivalents in virtual worlds, such as using robotic arms \cite{araujo2016snake}."
,,enumerate,"To apply on-body mechanical effects identical to that happen while pressing a button. For example, Moscatelli et al. created a push-button illusionary by modifying the contact area on a finger, which induced an erroneous estimation of finger displacement \cite{moscatelli2014change}. And Ito et al. \cite{ito2019midair} create a quasi-click sensation in midair by vibrating skin at neutral positions and action completion positions with ultrasound focuses."
,,text,"The following subsections elaborate on the haptic stimuli dimension, discussing the categories of values in terms of rendered haptic properties, correlated user manipulations, and requirements on actuating mechanisms and stimulating methods"
,,H2,Proximate objects 
,,text,Providing physical proxies focuses on creating objects resembling virtual counterparts and requires less knowledge of the further haptic perception process. The challenge lies in using limited physical objects to resemble the extensive variability of digital worlds. We introduce two types of proximate objects and explain ways to extend their variability below
D39,whole proxies,note,"Whole proximate objects refer to objects substituting the whole of a virtual object and are suitable to simulate global properties, like shape, weight distribution, and internal mechanics."
D40,partial proxies,note,Partial proximate objects refer to objects resembling a part of virtual objects. Haptic interfaces employing partial proximate objects simulate whole virtual objects by positioning the proxies according to predicted contacts between users and virtual objects.
,,H2,On-body effects
,,text,"One manipulates an object and simultaneously synthesizes the manipulation and resulting on-body mechanical effects to perceive the haptic properties. To simulate a haptic property by applying on-body mechanical effects correlated with manipulation, designers need to decide on mechanical effects that occur and are perceivable. The occurrence of mechanical effects is determined by the physical interaction between objects and the anatomy of involved body parts. Whether a mechanical effect is perceivable depends on human sensitivity, which is generally determined by mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors are different in adaptation rate (i.e., response to onset/offset of skin deformation vs. continued response during sustained skin deformation), the size of their receptive fields, and distribute differently in regions and layers in a human body \cite{ klatzky2003feeling}. Knowing the anatomy and sensitivity is critical for deciding what mechanical effects to apply and where to apply them, but knowledge about them is still limited."
,,text,"The following sections introduce schemes formatted as a mechanical effect correlated with a manipulation to display a haptic property. Prior review or research articles, according to their themes and logics, often group mechanical effects by their simulated sensations \cite{pacchierotti2017wearable, basdogan2020review}. Here we categorize them based on their displacement magnitude into vibration (low displacement magnitude), force/movement on the skin (medium displacement magnitude), and force/movement across joints (high displacement magnitude), as such categorization better reveals potential marriages between haptic stimuli and actuating mechanisms"
,,H3,Vibration
,,text,"When one contacts, taps, or slides across an object, vibration is naturally produced at cutaneous sites (hand) and even wider ranges (e.g., forearm) of interaction. Humans excel at sensing and interpreting vibrations to perceive contact (eventually shape), compliance, texture, and even proprioceptive sensations. "
D41,contacting,note,Vibration correlated with contacting for displaying contact and shape. Haptogram \cite{korres2016haptogram} used a tiled two-dimension array of ultrasound transducers to produce a focal point animated to simulate arbitrary two-dimension and three-dimension tactile shapes.
D42,norma vibration,note,Normal vibration correlated with tapping for displaying compliance is demonstrated by Kuchenbecker et al. \cite{kuchenbecker2006improving}.
D43,lateral vibration,note,"Lateral vibration correlated with swiping for displaying texture. Due to the viscoelastic properties of finger pulps, lateral movement across a surface induces tangential forces and lateral vibrations inside the finger pulp. Lederman et al. \cite{lederman1999perceiving} demonstrated that it is possible to render roughness by modulating this lateral movement as a function of finger displacement. "
D44,limb movement,note,"Vibration correlated with limb movement for displaying proprioceptive sensations. Cordo et al. \cite{cordo1995proprioceptive} and Goodwin et al. \cite{goodwin1972proprioceptive} showed that vibration at the tendons causes induction of angular estimation errors. Heo et al. \cite{heo2019pseudobend} modulated vibration from a rigid stick to produce illusions of stretching, bending, and twisting. Amemiya et al. \cite{amemiya2014distinct} used only vibration cues to create an illusion of attraction forces at the fingertips."
D45,tool-mediated,note,Vibrations can also augment virtual tool-mediated interactions. Due to their wide existence in natural tool-mediated interactions. Okamura et al. \cite{okamura2003haptic} played vibrations captured during natural interaction to simulate the feel of interactions such as cutting.
,,H3,Forces/deformations on the skin
,,text,"Human finger pads are inhomogeneous material similar to a non-linear spring that stiffens with increasing deformation and reaches maximum compression at small loads. As touching an object, the contact area on a finger pad grows and causes recruiting a quickly increasing number of mechanoreceptors correlated with contact force; therefore, people are highly sensitive to small forces \cite{serina1998structural} and force changes \cite{pawluk1999dynamic}. Such facts affect the sensation of pressure, compliance, curvature, and other material properties to be displayed."
D48,contact area,note,"Contact area correlated with probing for displaying compliance. When probing a compliant object deforming around the fingertip, the relationship between contact area and probing force helps to distinguish varying compliance \cite{srinivasan1995tactual, bicchi2000role}. On the other hand, modifying contact areas induces an erroneous estimation of finger displacement \cite{moscatelli2014change}. Kim et al. \cite{kim2013haptic} modulated such relations in real-time to create push-button or illusionary movement percepts."
D49,rotation,note,"Rotation of contact surface correlated with sliding for displaying geometry. As swiping a finger across a large-curvature surface (with curvature radius larger than fingertip size), the angle between the contact surface and finger changes, which plays a dominant role in haptic perception of large-radius curvature \cite{wijntjes2009local}. Wijntjes et al. \cite{wijntjes2009local} demonstrated that subjects could identify differences in virtual surface curvature displayed via the rotation of surface normal."
D46,lateral force/deformation,note,"Lateral force or skin-stretch on finger pads. Human fingers have increased sensitivity to shear forces compared with normal forces \cite{biggs2002tangential} and can perceive two degrees of freedom (DoFs) of shear and dynamic force information \cite{quek2014sensory}. Lateral force or skin-stretch happens when people swipe fingers across a surface to perceive texture, grab an object to weigh it, and grab a tool to probe an object. Lateral force or skin-stretch correlated with scanning for displaying geometry. When scanning a large-curvature surface, people also rely on the lateral components of forces to identify and locate the shape features of large-scale (size of a finger) bumps and dents \cite{robles2001force}. It has been shown that providing the lateral forces correlated with positions is sufficient to give a percept of a bump or divet, without physical geometry or even with a conflicting one \cite{ manuel2000tactile}. A desktop lateral pin display used this phenomenon to stimulate correlated neural patterns \cite{ hayward2014spatio}."
D46(这两个是一个values，但是要分段),lateral force/deformation,note,"Lateral force or skin-stretch correlated with sliding for displaying friction or texture. As a fingerpad slides across a surface, the skin stretches (displays) tangentially opposite to the direction of motion. Provancher \cite{provancher2009fingerpad} and Sylvester \cite{ sylvester2007effects} found it possible to increase the perception of friction by rendering a small amount of skin-stretch. Friction induced by skin-stretch is also used to simulate weight \cite{schorr2017fingertip}. Schorr et al. \cite{schorr2013sensory, schorr2015tactor} and Quek et al. \cite{quek2014augmentation} demonstrated that skin-stretch induced via stylus was an intuitive feedback modality to substitute for kinesthetic force feedback and helped discriminate stiffness. Skin-stretch happens on not only the finger pad that directly touches an object but also the hairy skin (e.g., around the joints) during flexion, which has a role in proprioception. Edin et al. \cite{edin1995skin} showed that participants with anesthetized forefingers could nonetheless detect finger position associated with skin-stretch at the edges of the anesthetized regions."
D47,normal force/deformation,note,blank
,,H3,Forces/deformations across joints
D50,forces/deformation across joints,note,"When touching an object, people always receive reaction forces. Sometimes the forces are so subtle that buffed or resolved by our skin and other compliant tissues. While the forces are big enough, they can influence muscles and joints. Force-position relationships, either reaction-force-resulted-from-motion (impedance) or in another arbitrary perspective, the reaction-motion (admittance) resulting  from their input force, can reflect many object properties, like shape, material, and dynamics \footnote{See https://www.chai3d.org/.}. Interface applying forces/motions across joints can be divided into two categories. One generates the effect between a user and an external environment, including grounded force-feedback devices. The other generates forces between different body parts of a user, including exoskeleton and other force-feedback devices with one or more pair(s) of ends mounted on two parts (across at least one joint) on a human body. A special way is EMS that elicits proprioception by causing the contraction of an antagonist muscle located on the opposite side of a skeletal muscle that targets the force sensation. It caused force/displacement on a human body using human body parts as actuators. It has been used to activate hands and arms to simulate manipulations ranging from the dexterious (e.g., playing musical instruments) to the forceful (e.g., hiting and being hit, pushing a wall, and lifting heavy objects) \cite{nith2021dextrems, lopes2015impacto,lopes2017providing, lopes2018adding, takahashi2021increasing}."

,,H1,Grounding Methods 
,,text,"Grounding methods describe how an interface situates its force grounds.A common categorization of haptic interfaces proposed by Hannaford et al. divided haptic interfaces into the grounded (off-body) and the wearable (on-body) based on whether an interface is mounted off an operator's body or not \cite{hannaford2016haptics}. Mercado et al. \cite{mercado2021haptics} classify the actuator types of encountered-type haptic devices (ETHDs) into grounded and ungrounded; grounded ETHDs contains two categories of robotic arms and fixed platforms, and ETHDs comprise unmanned air vehicles, mobile platforms, and wearable ETHDs."
D51,grounding-off-body,note,Grounding-off-body devices (\ref{tab:Grounded-off-body}) have a stable standing site . Such devices usually have a limited workspace defined by a standing site as well as the reach of an actuating mechanism like a robotic arm \cite{araujo2016snake} or an ultrasound emitter \cite{makino2016haptoclone}).
D52,moving-off-body,note,"Moving-off-body haptic devices (\ref{tab:Moving-off-body}) can move in the world by utilizing mobile platforms such as drones \cite{hoppe2018vrhapticdrones} and robots \cite{suzuki2019shapebots, suzuki2020roomshift, kim2019swarmhaptics}, gaining a larger workspace."
D53/D54(D53和D54都是用这一段note),ungrounding,note,Ungrounding devices (\ref{tab:Ungrounded}) are not attached to environments or users. Users can carry ungrounded devices around in an unencumbered manner. 
D55,grounding-on-multiple-body-parts,note,"Grounding-on-multiple-body-parts. Similar to ungrounded devices, on-body devices enable extended workspace and unencumbered usage. We divide on-body devices into two groups. Devices grounded on multiple body parts (\ref{tab:Grounded-multiple}) usually drive or constraint movement between the multiple body parts (i.e., haptic stimuli -- forces/constraints across joints)."
D56,grounding-on-single-body-part,note,"Grounding-on-single-body-part devices (\ref{tab:Grounded-single}) usually generate cutaneous effects (i.e., haptic stimuli -- vibration and skin stretch). Exceptional haptic interfaces that generate force across joints without connection to other body parts or environments employ propeller-induced forces \cite{heo2018thor} or inertia forces \cite{badshah2012gyrotab, gugenheimer2016gyrovr}."
,,,
,,H1,Stimulating Methods
,,text,"Similar to the categorization by Culbertson [49], we define three methods how users
interact with haptic interfaces "
D57,grasped,note,"Users must hold grasped haptic devices (\ref{tab:Grasped}) in certain gestures to perceive haptic sensations. Grasped haptic interfaces can be divided into three groups. The first group of interfaces simulates objects and consists of a stylus, and users have to explore the objects with the stylus. The second group replaces virtual objects, users’ exploration of virtual objects is not via a stylus but is limited to a certain gesture type, e.g., grasping \cite{choi2016wolverine,choi2018claw}, pitching \cite{lee2019torc}, and one-finger touching \cite{whitmire2018haptic,benko2016normaltouch}. The last group replaces virtual handheld tools, such as guns and swords, that are meant to be grasped \cite{tsai2020elastoscillation,zenner2019drag,shigeyama2019transcalibur}. Although the three groups all require grasping gestures, the scenarios are different, the grasping gestures are closer to the natural gestures in the later scenarios, leading users to perceive fewer limitations and more realism."
D58,worn,note,"Haptic devices that are worn on body parts or attached to the skin maintain contact with users for delivering haptic stimuli while releasing users from holding certain gestures. Devices worn on hands provide simultaneous kinetic or cutaneous feedback in response to users’ manipulating objects. Haptic interfaces can also be worn on and deliver haptic stimuli to body parts with fewer manipulation functions, such as the torso \cite{prasad2014haptimoto, foo2019iterative,
delazio2018force}, head \cite{rietzler2017vair, chu2021motionring, tseng2020skin, gugenheimer2016gyrovr}, and arms \cite{ion2015skin, zhu2020pneusleeve,
muthukumarana2020touch,lopes2015impacto, gong2018jetto}. It needs to be noted that some devices are worn in terms of stimulating methods, but the entire devices are not wearable, e.g., the interface shown in \ref{tab:Worn} E \cite{huppert2021guidecopter}."
D59,encountered,note,"Instead of constantly being grasped or worn by users, encountered haptic devices (\ref{tab:Encountered}) reach users (or reversely) only when contacts between virtual objects and users should happen \cite{mercado2021haptics}, enabling bare-hand and free-gesture exploration. Encountered haptic devices can either employ a positioning system to deliver haptic stimuli or be stationary to be reached by users. Typical haptic stimuli of encountered haptic devices include localized object properties (proximate objects), vibrations or topological changes on touchscreens, or ultrasound in mid-air."

,,H1,Source energy to mechanical energy
,,H2,Active materials
,,text,"converting source energy (e.g., electric and thermal energy) to mechanical changes (e.g., simple deformation, change of stiffness, and vibration)"
D60,electrostastic,note,"Electrostatic-force actuation relies on the Coulombic force of attraction between two oppositely charged and electrically disconnected conductors; DC voltage generates attraction forces, while AC voltage generates vibrations. We identify three ways to apply electrostatic forces (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-electrostatic}). The first is to apply between a user’s body and external electrodes (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-electrostatic} E and F). For example, Kato et al. proposed a display method where a hand wearing an electrically grounded glove moves across printed circuit patterns connected to a high and periodic voltage to feel vibrations and frictional sensations \cite{kato2018double}. Another example applies electrostatic force between a bare fingertip and a metal surface since the outer layer of the skin, the air gap, and the insulating layer of metal can act as a somewhat resistive dielectric layer. And Shultz et al. explained clarified what could affect the perceived electrostatic haptic effects (e.g., surface roughness and dryness of finger skin) and presented mathematical models enabling precise control of the electrostatic forces \cite{shultz2015surface}. The second is to apply electrostatic forces between components of a mechanism (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-electrostatic} D). For example, DextrES presents a mechanism composing two overlapped metal strips with a dielectric layer in between. It modulates the electrostatic attraction between the strips to render kinesthetic feedback between a fingertip and the wrist \cite{ hinchet2018dextres}. The third is to configure actuators (i.e.,  electroactive polymer actuators or EPAs) by embedding a dielectric elastic polymers layer between two electrode layers ((Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-electrostatic} A, B, and C). Based on the employed polymers, the actuators can be classified into two types: 1) Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) utilize dielectric elastomer film that contracts in the thickness direction and expands in the film plane directions due to the compression between electrode layers when applying a voltage; 2) Ionic EPAs leverages polymer with diffused ions, the displacements of which drives change in shape or volume during electrical stimulation. EPAs can produce various deformations by altering the patterns of electrodes. EPAs are used in on-demand surface texture augmentation that is capable of physically forming local topographic features \cite{marette2017flexible, tiwari2018highly} and vibrations, used in, e.g., a tabletop display called TableHop \cite{sahoo2016tablehop}."
D61,electromagnetic,note,"Electromagnetic mechanisms leverage the phenomenon that electrical currents produce electromagnetic fields applying force to magnets or moving electrical charges (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-electromagnetic}). Freeman et al. adjusted coil attitude to generate specific magnetic fields for users holding a magnetic stylus to perceive tissue stiffness \cite{tong2017magnetic}. Magnetips \cite{mcintosh2019magnetips}deploys a coil generating electromagnetic pulse bursts on a mobile device and a magnet worn on a user's fingernail so that users feel around-device mid-air haptic feedback. PokeRing \cite{je2018pokering} and MagTics \cite{pece2017magtics} constructed mini magnetic solenoids comprising a coil and a moveable plunger to generate bidirectional linear movement. (Off-the-shelf electromagnetic actuators such as solenoids, DC motors, ERM, and LRA are not discussed here.)"
D62,piezoelectric,note,"Based on the inverse piezoelectric effect, piezoelectric materials deform when voltage is applied (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-piezoelectric}). Piezoelectric actuators in different piezoelectric materials (rigid and soft) and structural configurations produce various haptic stimuli, e.g., high-frequency vibration and net force, as shown in the review articles by Mohith et al. \cite{mohith2020recent} and Gao et al. \cite{gao2020piezoelectric}. Rigid piezoelectric materials, such as crystals and ceramics, have larger piezoelectric constants, i.e., generate larger volume change subjected to an electric field, while flexible ones, such as polymers and polymer-inorganic composites, have smaller piezoelectric constants but are often favored due to their compliant and transparent properties. Since piezoelectric deformation is small (around 0.1\% over material dimension), researchers have proposed amplifying configurations, often called unimorph/bimorph bender, multilayer, structure-amplified, and stepper motor configuration. Multilayer actuators (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-piezoelectric}A) can reduce operating voltages and combine responses from the different layers to achieve a broader range of motion, as used by LateralPaD \cite{ dai2012lateralpad}. Bending actuators (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-piezoelectric}B) consist of piezoelectric layers in bimorph or unimorph configurations (e.g., PiezoHapt, TDK Electronics), where unsymmetric expansion between the two layers along the length direction induces significant bending deflection when subjected to an external electric field. Structure-amplified piezo actuators consist of an external structural amplifier, such as bridge mechanisms, which consist of piezoelectric ceramics sandwiched between two metal end caps (e.g.,  PowerHap™ 0904H014V060, TDK, image) (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-piezoelectric}D), and flexure hinge mechanisms, which employ monolithic compliant structures (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-piezoelectric}E)."
D63,phase transformation,note,"Based on thermoplastic stiffness-changing material, Carpenter et al. \cite{carpenter2019healable} introduced a form of kinesthetic glove that can switch between flexible or stiffened states. The glove is made from spandex impregnated with a thermoplastic polymer, so heating or cooling the textile just above or below its glass transition temperature dramatically changes its mechanical properties. Liquid crystal elastomers are based on an operating principle that involves rapid phase transitions between nematic and isotropic phases. Normally, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) contain rigid, anisotropic mesogenic units incorporated within polymer chains that remain mobile. When stimulated to the nematic phase, the mesogenic units become aligned in a direction without any crystalline orientation. The phase transformation can be created in response to thermal excitation, ultraviolet excitation, or electrical stimulation."
D64,shape memory,note,"Shape memory materials, including alloys, polymers, and composites, are capable of recovering a predetermined geometric shape (memorized) after a plastic deformation by inducing a phase transformation \cite{sreekumar2007critical}. At the base of this shape memory effect, there are different mechanical properties associated with different stable phases. Shape memory alloy (SMA) wires shaped into springs contract when electricity is applied to reach specific temperatures and expand when electricity is removed. They are widely adopted by HCI researchers since they are readily available online and require limited expertise. We identify three themes (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-sma}). One is SMA springs attached on and reshaping the skin to deliver tactile sensations, like pinching, stretching, and shear force, as demonstrated by Springlets \cite{hamdan2019springlets}, Foo et al. \cite{foo2019iterative}, Besse et al. \cite{besse2017flexible}, and Muthukumarana et al. \cite{muthukumarana2020touch}. The other is using SMA springs to control end effectors. For example, Springlets use one SMA spring to move or transform objects on the skin surface. Hwang et al. \cite{hwang2017design} proposed a miniature haptic ring, where multiple SMA springs control a 3-DoF end effector to display touch/pressure and shearing force to a finger pad."
D65,rheological,note,"Electro- and magneto-rheological fluids or elastomers contain suspension of metal particles and change in viscosity when an external field is applied. There are essentially two types of rheological fluids that can be electrically modulated rheology or magnetically modulated. When subjected to an external magnetic or electric field, the particles orient and build chains in response to the inter-particle interaction. This translates into an increased resistance to deformation. Application schemes of MRF in HCI domain can be categorized into three groups (Figure \ref{fig:am-sts-rf}). The first is to let users touch MRF directly; for example, Rizzo et al. prove that MRF can simulate tissue properties \cite{rizzo2015displaying}. The second is to embed MRF between moving parts of  rigid actuators, such as a clutch \cite{najmaei2015design},  joystick \cite{chen2019development}, and linear actuator \cite{chen2019fw}, to control the motions. The last is to embed MRF into structures made from polymer for stiffness-changing mechanisms \cite{biswas2019emerging}. MRF-based  actuators can produce very strong forces but often require the driving material to be liquid, which can lead to cost and design constraints. In addition, these devices resist motion rather than produce motion."
D66,gel actuators,note,"Some gels generate mechanical changes (such as in volume and stiffness) when stimulated by pH, magnetic fields, light, or temperature. And once configured in some structures like multilayer, the mechanical changes can be further transferred \cite{miruchna2015geltouch}. A  wide  range of gels is available that can be stimulated in different manners that lend themselves to robust effects.  However, the gels must be maintained in a semiliquid form, which can make resulting devices mechanically sensitive. Additionally, the gel actuators typically result in relatively low bandwidths."
,,H2,Passive mechanisms
,,text,"Passive mechanisms utilize mechanical structures without external sources of power to present haptic profiles. Compared to the abovementioned mechanisms requiring power sources, passive mechanisms offer unchangeable force-displacement profiles but can be simpler, lighter, and less expensive. As a result, passive mechanisms are useful to applications that do not necessitate dynamic haptic profiles but favor lightweight, robust, and cost-effective features. Passive mechanisms can also serve as passive proxies in active mechanisms, as shown in section \ref{sec:proximate objects}. Passive mechanisms commonly leverage magnetic force, material flexibility, and structure flexibility, as described below."
D67,magnetic forces,note,"Researchers have shown many techniques using accessible magnetic materials to create various haptic sensations, such as embedding magnets to create tactile physical controls (e.g., buttons, sliders, switches, and dials) \cite{weiss2011fingerflux, zheng2018mechamagnets}, editing magnetic patterns on magnetic rubber sheets to build on-touchscreen haptic controls \cite{yasu2019magnetact}, using a mat made of magnets array and a handheld magnetic device to render bumpy surfaces \cite{yasu2015bump}, and layering multiple magnetic sheets with simple magnetic patterns to generate various tactile texture patterns \cite{yasu2020magnelayer, yasu2017magnetic}. Magneto-haptics\cite{ogata2018magneto} presented a computational estimation method of haptic texture generated by magnets distributions."
D68,flexible material,note,"Elastic materials can provide touch feelings with simpler mechanical structures than rigid ones. Some string-based VR controllers leveraged elastic strings to provide progressive resistance force for simulating compliant objects, such as ElasticVR \cite{tsai2019elasticvr}, Elastic-Arm \cite{achibet2015elastic}, FlexiFingers \cite{achibet2017flexifingers}, and DextrES \cite{hinchet2018dextres}. ElastOscillation \cite{tsai2020elastoscillation} presented a device that employs elastic bands modulated by a motor and connected to a mass. When shaking the device, users perceive damped oscillation, like swirling a glass of liquid. Bianchi et al. \cite{bianchi2016wearable} proposed modulating the stretch state of fabric through DC motors to exhibit different stiffness, which can simulate different textures."
D69,flexible structure,note,"Structural-flexibility-based mechanisms modulate mechanical properties by editing micro and macro structures of objects. They leverage metamaterial, origami and kirigami, and compliant structures. The structures add flexibility and movement allowance to a body of rigid material. Compared with material flexibility, structural flexibility can be fabricated without special material and is compatible with accessible fabrication methods, such as 3D printing and laser cutting. Metamaterial is based on microstructures with predictable elasticity by the beam diameter and beam density \cite{ion2019understanding,schumacher2015microstructures}. Embedding the tileable and parametric microstructures into 3D-printed or laser-cut objects allows objects to deform in specific ways in response to pressure. Kirigami Haptic Swatches \cite{chang2020kirigami} leverages kirigami and origami-based structures to render different sets of haptic feedback (i.e., linear, bistable, bouncing snap-through, and rotational force behaviors, respectively). Compliant mechanisms achieve force and motion transmission from, rather than rigid-body joints alone, elastic single-body deformation, which simplifies mechanical structures and allows digital fabrication \cite{le2019design, mazursky2020compact}. Ondulé \cite{he2019ondule} uses helical spring structures to create parameterizable deformation behaviors, including compress, extend, twist, and bend, in 3D-printable models."

,,H1,Simple mechanical changes to complex ones
,,text,"Researchers have developed methods to increase the range or DoF of small and simple mechanical changes. For instance, in piezoelectric actuators and electroactive polymer actuators, multilayer configurations are used to accumulate the force and displacement generated by single layers (and to reduce driving voltages). And for actuation mechanisms producing pulsed, precise, and small displacement, such as electromagnetic, electrostatic, and inverse piezoelectric mechanisms, stepping motor configurations are applied to generate controllable force, torque, and displacement in a rotary or linear track incrementally. This section introduces the mechanisms that have not been common enough to be integrated into predetermined actuators and are widely used by haptic interfaces with different actuation mechanisms (see Table \ref{tab:am-stc} in Appendix)."
D73,spatial distribution,note,"The spatial distribution of independently controllable simple actuators enables spatiotemporal animations of simple mechanical changes. The distribution patterns include arrays and organic distributions on a user’s body. In the arrays, the cells can be motor-driven pins used to render various 2.5D shapes in desktop-scale \cite{nakagaki2016materiable} and in handheld-scale \cite{ yoshida2020pocopo}. Array configurations are also widely combined with smart materials to form flexible, thin, and dense tactile displays, such as a $4\times4$ DEA array \cite{marette2017flexible}, $3\times9$ matrix of dielectric elastomer microactuators (DEMA) \cite{yun2019soft}, a $2\times2$ array of dielectric elastomer linear actuators \cite{zhao2020wearable}, a display made of spandex fabric electrostatically actuated by $3\times3$ array of electrodes \cite{sahoo2016tablehop},  and an $8\times6$ vibrotactile actuator array that uses a film of PVDF and pairs of electrodes \cite{choi2019transparent}. Other than regular arrays,  researchers distributed actuators along the human body more organically, like a line of solenoids around a finger \cite{je2018pokering}, wrist \cite{pece2017magtics}, and eye \cite{tseng2020skin}, a solenoids distribution on hand \cite{ vechev2019tactiles}, SMA on-body stickers to render pressure, skin-stretch, and vibration effects \cite{muthukumarana2020touch}, airbags across an arm \cite{zhu2020pneusleeve} and torso \cite{delazio2018force} to provide haptic feelings such as punch, hug, and snake moving."
D74,mechanical mechanisms multiple 1DOF to single multiDOF,note,"Many haptic interfaces, such as those applying directional force-feedback and skin-stretch \cite{pacchierotti2017wearable}, require one end effector with multiple DoFs. Thus researchers proposed mechanisms that take in multiple simple actuation and output one controllable multi-DoF actuation. For example, delta mechanisms  \cite{schorr2017fingertip} and three Revolute-Revolute-Spherical mechanisms (3RRS) \cite{chinello2017three} use three rotary actuators driving the three legs of an end effector with 3DoF. Traditionally, such mechanisms are driven by electromechanical motors and made from multiple rigid parts and pins and hinges. Recently, researchers have adopted new source-to-simple actuations, such as piezoelectric stacks \cite{ pinskier2018development}, piezoelectric benders \cite{mcclintock2018millidelta, mintchev2019portable}, and SMA wires \cite{abuzaiter2015development}, and leveraged new mechanical structures, such as compliant structures \cite{ pinskier2018development} and origami structures \cite{mcclintock2018millidelta, mintchev2019portable, kalafat2021novel}. The adoption introduces the advantages of the new source-to-simple actuating mechanisms and mechanical structures to the resulting mechanisms, such as high bandwidth and high precision brought by piezoelectric actuators and simplified structure and fabrication enabled by compliant and origami structures."
D75,string based,note,"String/rod-based mechanisms modulated the length or tension of strings/rods connecting a grounding point and an stimulating point, e.g., the shoulder and finger, with unidirectional braking or retracting mechanism to provide haptic sensations.  It takes in simple mechanical changes, such as magnitude changes in braking forces, and generates complex sensations, such as force feedbacks correlated with fingers and hand positions in a 3D space. String/rod-based mechanisms vary by machine configurations and connected s. In Grabity \cite{choi2017grabity}, the mechanism was mounted between the thumb and index finger and utilized a gliding-through rod and a brake to create rigid grasping force feedback. Wolverine \cite{choi2016wolverine}, also employing rods and brakes, was worn on the thumb and three fingers to simulate objects held in pad opposition type grasps. In DextrES \cite{hinchet2018dextres}, the mechanisms consist of two overlapped metal strips with a dielectric layer in between, and provide sliding resistance when voltage is on. The flexible mechanisms are worn between the fingertips and the waist to render on-demand kinesthetic feedback. Wireality consists of retractable string reels with a solenoid to lock the string. The reels are mounted on the shoulder, and the other ends of the strings are linked to hand joints to arrest individual joints in 3D space \cite{fang2020wireality}."
D76,pneumatic & hydraulic mechanisms,note,"Fluidic mechanisms consisting of working fluids (e.g., air, water, or oil) and chambers convert the simple output of pumps to simulate pressures, shape changes, or motions, and are soft and monolithic alternatives to rigid multi-part mechanisms. Air chambers were employed to build buttons, knobs, and sliders with programmable activation forces \cite{vazquez20153d}. Chambers were widely used in wearable haptic devices, as the mechanical compliance of chambers is compatible with human bodies. For example, airbags were deployed to arm \cite{zhu2020pneusleeve} and torso  \cite{delazio2018force} to render haptic sensations such as punch, hug, and snake moving across the body. HydroRing \cite{han2018hydroring}presented a finger-worn device using liquid traveling through a thin, flexible latex tube worn across a finger pad to simulate tactile sensations of pressure, vibration, and temperature. HapBead \cite{han2020hapbead} leveraged a microfluidic channel to oscillate a small bead in the channel to create vibration-like tactile feedback on the skin. Inflatable airbags are compact when deactivated and inflate into different geometries when in play, thus were used as on-demand proximate objects in devices worn on palms \cite{hu2019pneu, teng2018pupop} in room-scale shape-changing interfaces \cite{suzuki2020lifttiles}."
